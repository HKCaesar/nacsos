This means that their combination might allow us to characterize not only a single model but also a larger group of models. Such a classification would make it easier to identify patterns among the spread of model results in model intercomparison studies that aim to inform policy-relevant questions. What follows is only a preliminary attempt at such a classification that aims to illustrate one important application of model diagnostics. 5.2.1. Classification ofparticipating models In Table 2, we use simple qualitative characterizations of the indicator values: low, high, and medium/mixed categories based on the results shown in Section 4. The medium/mixed category is for those models that fall in between the low and high clusters or that move from one cluster to the other over time. For an overview of the numerical values on which the diagnostic indicators for each model are based, view Table S4 in the SOM. Some models show indicator values that are fully in line with a low-response vs. high-response classification. A high-response model would be expected to show higher emission reductions, lower carbon intensity relative to energy intensity, and a more decisive transformation of the primary energy mix — a high/ low/high pattern with regards to RAI/CoEI/TI. Conversely, low-response models would be expected to show a low/high/ low pattern. This is true for DNE21+, GEM-E3 and WITCH, which can be classified as a low-response model, and for GCAM, MERGE-ETL, REMIND and MESSAGE, which can be identified as high-response models. The indicators of the other four models do not fit the low, high or medium response patterns fully, as they include medium or mixed values. Nevertheless, at least two indicators of most models match the low-response vs. high-response patterns. For this preliminary classification, we define IMACLIM as a low-response model, IMAGE as a high-response model and AIM-Enduse and POLES as medium-response models based on the largest overlap with the low/medium/high response classes defined in Table 3. There is no clear correlation between the cost per abatement value (CAV) indicator and the model classification based on RAI, CoEI and TI. This may be due to the fact that high-response models may exhibit both relatively high emission reductions and high mitigation costs that boost both the numerator and the denominator of the CAV. This would indicate that the CAV provides complementary information to the high- vs. low-response model characteristics. Section 4.4 suggests that high CAV values come from the subset of equilibrium models that include the full impact on the economy. It is worthwhile noting that some of the models classified as low response models in Table 2 are also among the models with a low measure of low-carbon energy supply technology variety, as shown in Table 1. However, a high technology variety measure does not automatically lead to the classification as a high-response model. The measure only covers the supply side, and a high variety oflow-carbon technologies does not automatically translate into their large-scale use. 5.2.2. Preliminary classification scheme From our classification of the participating models, we derive a preliminary classification scheme based on the indicators RAI, CoEI and TI and the model type (Table 3). We have added the model type to the classification scheme rather than the CAV itself because the model type determines the cost components that can actually be measured. However, this may be changed in the future, or the CAV may be added, as our understanding about the explanatory power of the CAV improves. The CAV definitely provides useful additional information about the magnitude of mitigation costs in climate policy analyses with quantitative mitigation targets. In such a setting, the required emissions reductions are largely fixed, and the low vs. high responsiveness of models will give a good indication about the level of carbon prices that is needed in the models to reach the target. Thus, the choice ofmitigation target and the responsiveness of models largely determine the denominator of the CAV. The indicator itself will then specify to what extent the abatement value translates into mitigation costs. Therefore, highest cost estimates can be expected from general equilibrium models measuring full economic costs with low responsiveness and high CAV (IMACLIM and to a lesser extent GEM-E3 and WITCH). In turn, lowest cost estimates will be expected in partial equilibrium models with high responsiveness and low CAV (IMAGE). We note that models that do not match but are close to the indicator patterns in Table 3 can also be classified based on this scheme. For instance, a model with a low abatement index, a high CoEI and a medium or mixed transformation index can be considered a low-response model. The derived preliminary classification serves mainly illustrative purposes. Further research and the integration of diagnostic results from more models are needed to establish a robust classification scheme. Ultimately, the value of such a scheme needs to be judged against its ability to characterize differences in model outputs and policy implications in a variety of contexts. As a preliminary test of the model classification, we present results from the",221.86872

We would thus expect that models with a high primary energy TI are strongly inclined to reduce carbon intensity and exhibit a relatively low carbon over energy intensity (CoEI) values. Everything else being equal, a lower carbon intensity translates to lower emissions and thus higher emissions abatement. Fig. 11 plots the primary energy TI results of this study against the CoEI. Fig. 12 plots the primary energy TI against the relative abatement index (RAI). While a negative correlation between the TI and the CoEI and a positive correlation between the TI and the RAI are clearly confirmed, these correlations are stronger in 2050 than in 2100. This is because even a strong transformation of the primary energy mix toward low carbon energy sources reaches its limits in further reducing carbon intensity and emissions — except in GCAM, where the large shift to bioenergy with CCS continues to boost negative emissions as carbon prices increase. We also investigate the correlation of the CoEI with the RAI (Fig. 13). There is indeed a negative correlation between CoEI and RAI. Higher relative abatement (high RAI) tends to come with a strong inclination to reduce CI (low CoEI). The negative correlation of RAI and CoEI is strongest in situations of a significant carbon tax signal that has not yet pushed the decarbonization to its limits. In the case of a low carbon tax signal, the model response may not be strong enough to induce a clear correlation (see Fig. S2 in the SOM). The correlation between the abatement response to carbon prices and the inclination to reduce carbon intensity is an important result of our diagnostic analysis. The RAI and CoEI are complementary by construction, since the RAI is related to the residual CO2 FFI emissions, which in principle can be achieved with a large range of CoEIs. The negative correlation between the RAI and CoEI (Fig. 13), the positive correlation between the RAI and the TI (Fig. 12), and the negative correlation between the TI and CoEI (Fig. 11) suggest that many models show a high/low/high or a low/ high/low pattern for RAI/CoEI/TI.",221.212046

A high CAV means comparatively higher mitigation costs for a given emissions reduction and carbon price trajectory than in the case with a low CAV. For partial equilibrium models, it essentially describes the ratio between average and marginal abatement costs. For general equilibrium models, macro-economic feedbacks are also factored in. This becomes particularly evident for IMACLIM, for which the CAV exceeds unity until mid-century. Fig. 10 shows the development of the cost per abatement value indicator for the exponentially increasing and constant high tax scenarios. In the exponential carbon tax case, the CAV is declining over time for all models. This indicates that after discounting, the increase in mitigation cost is more than outweighed by the increase in emission reductions, taking into account that the present value of the carbon tax remains constant when assuming a discount rate of 4% per year. The constant tax scenario results in a relatively constant CAV. The ordering of models in terms of CAV is largely preserved over time and across the increasing and constant tax scenarios. IMACLIM shows CAV values that are multiple times as high as those of the other models. DNE21+, GEM-E3, GCAM, REMIND and WITCH have medium CAV values.

This is due to assumptions of imperfect foresight combined with market and institutional imperfections that, under a carbon tax, can result in GDP losses that are far more significant than in the case of economies with frictionless markets and non-distortive fiscal systems. Fig. 9 shows a positive correlation between mitigation costs and cumulative emissions reductions from different carbon tax scenarios in 2050. This correlation is still mostly intact in 2100, although some models (IMACLIM, MESSAGE, WITCH) suggest that the increasing high tax case ($50 increasing) can lead to somewhat lower cost relative to the amount of emission reductions than the constant high ($200) tax case. The initial shock from the constant $200 tax can be very costly in the short term, and the 4% discount rate gives a large weight to such short-term losses. 4.4.2. Cost per abatement value As can be seen in Figs. 8 and 9, differences in the cost levels across models increase with increasing mitigation costs in the more stringent carbon tax scenarios. We can study the model differences through a cost per abatement value (CAV) indicator taking into account the mitigation costs (MitCosts) over the period from 2010 to year t, discounted at a rate r of4% per year relative to the value of reduced emissions, measured in greenhouse gas emissions reduction (GHG Red) times the carbon price (CPrice) over the same period 2010 to t, also discounted at 4%.

The left panel ofFig. 6 shows changes in the structure offinal energy use by type of delivered energy. Final energy is categorized as solids (i.e. coal and biomass used directly by end users), liquids (primarily oil), and grids and hydrogen. Grids include electricity, piped gas and district heat. In the no-policy baseline scenario, models consistently move toward grids in the long run, indicating an electrification of final energy use. In the carbon tax case, this trend is accelerated in most models, albeit to a varying degree. Changes of the primary energy mix are shown in the right-hand panel of Fig. 6. All models show that the carbon tax pushes primary energy away from fossil fuels, though the extent varies greatly between models. Compared to the other models, the carbon tax brings only low gains for non-fossil energy in IMACLIM due to strong deployment of carbon capture and storage for fossil energy. For most models, the carbon tax induces a strong shift away from coal, which in the baseline scenario would gain an increasing share of the energy mix. As most models show that the carbon tax shifts final energy toward grids and primary energy toward non-fossils, the rate at which these categories are transformed can be indicative of how flexible the energy mix is in response to a carbon price. The rate of transformation can be expressed with transformation indicators that measure the changes in the energy mix relative to 2005 (see [22,23] for applications of a similar metric to measure the distance between different technology portfolios). We apply a transformation indicator (TI) that ranges between 0 and 2. A TI of0 indicates no change in the share among the variables of the category; 2 indicates an absolute shift with one variable rising from 0% to 100% of the share and another falling from 100% to 0%. Shifts between these extremes have a TI between 0 and 2. The TI, relating to the base year of 2005, can be defined as follows, with S1, S2, etc.",221.2275

Fig. 5 shows the development of the CoEI over time for the constant and exponentially increasing high tax scenarios. It can be seen that all models increasingly rely on carbon intensity reductions in the increasing tax scenario (CoEI decreasing over time), while the ratio of energy and carbon intensity reductions stabilizes in the constant tax scenario. As models go to negative emissions (=negative carbon intensities) under the increasing carbon tax, the decrease of the CoEI generally levels off, indicating a limit on the amount of net negative emissions that can be achieved (although GCAM reaches this limit at a strongly negative level). In the constant carbon tax case, all models except POLES show a leveling off of the CoEI decrease in the second half of the century, whether negative emissions are achieved or not. This may be due to the models avoiding the most expensive decarbonization options without an increase in the carbon price. The model differences in the CoEI are fairly robust across carbon tax scenarios from 2040 on. We can identify different groups ofmodels — some that reduce CI only slightly more than EI: WITCH, GEM-E3, IMACLIM, DNE21+; and some that are strongly inclined to reduce CI: IMAGE, MERGE-ETL, MESSAGE, REMIND and particularly GCAM, which again forms a class ofits own due to its large potential for negative emissions.

In principle, regional marginal abatement cost curves should vary with regional differences in technology performance and costs, energy resource endowments and final energy demand. Among the participating global models, such regional variations are generally much less significant than the inter-model differences, as illustrated by Fig. S1 in the SOM. The models with higher RAI values on the global level also have higher RAI across the regions. 4.1.3. Abatement under different carbon price levels The RAI as constructed above shows model responses to particular carbon price levels. We can also characterize the impact of carbon price levels with marginal abatement cost (MAC) curves that show emission reductions as a function of carbon price. Fig. 3 constructs such MAC curves from the results of both the high and the low exponentially increasing carbon tax scenarios. The left panel shows the emissions abatements achieved by two carbon prices levels reaching $50 and $200 in 2045 after having increased from the initial 2010 prices of $12.50 and $50 respectively. In the right panel, these prices have reached $200 and $800 by 2080. The points on the curves indicate what levels of emission reductions are achieved at marginal abatement costs up to the level of the carbon price in the given years. The MAC curves in Fig. 3 have been extended to the origin reflecting the fact that baseline emissions are based on a zero carbon price. A common feature of the MAC curves (in 2045) of all models except GCAM is that the relative emissions reduction in the low carbon tax scenario is similar to or larger than the additional emissions reduction between the low carbon tax and the four times higher carbon tax. This gives the MAC curves a convex form with a steepening slope for increasing carbon price levels and increasing convexity over time. In the second half of the century, even the lower carbon tax leads to an exploitation of most available emissions reduction opportunities so that the additional abatement opportunities are diminishing. Among the participating models, GCAM alone shows high additional reductions from a higher tax level. This is because GCAM allows for significant expansion of lands for bioenergy crops in the carbon tax case, facilitated partly by changes in human diets away from cattle and resulting in large-scale bioenergy carbon capture and storage (BECCS) and negative emissions [20].",221.85995

We establish indicators characterizing the following model responses to carbon taxes: 4.1.1. Emission pathways The decarbonization of economic activity is central to climate change mitigation. The top and bottom panels of Fig. 1 show how, according to the participating models, a carbon tax starting at $50 in 2010 and increasing by 4% per year as well as a constant carbon tax of $200 impact global CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion and industry (FFI) compared to the no-policy baseline scenario. Since several models have a time horizon ending in 2050 (AIM-Enduse, DNE21+ and GEM-E3), we show the results for 2005–2050 and for 2005–2100 in separate panels. Since the carbon tax in either scenario takes effect in 2010, we already see significant reactions to high tax levels in that year. In the increasing tax case, all models continue to reduce emissions throughout the time horizon, whereas in the constant tax case, some models show an upward reversal in the long term after an initial reduction. This is due to the depreciation of the current value of the carbon tax in a growing economy. In both tax cases, there are pronounced model differences. MERGE-ETL shows a particularly high increase in baseline emissions due to wide-spread adoption of coal-to-liquids production. GCAM and WITCH show strong emission reductions in the early years of the constant carbon tax scenario. This is contrary to current real-world trends, but it should be noted that the global carbon tax of $200 far exceeds any climate policy efforts to date both in its level and in its coverage. In the later years of the increasing carbon tax case, GCAM shows very high negative emissions, primarily due to a large potential for bioenergy carbon capture and sequestration (BECCS), which is exploited in the case of high carbon prices. 4.1.2. Relative abatement index To illustrate the model differences, we define a relative abatement index (RAI) characterizing the emission reductions in a carbon tax scenario relative to the baseline: RAIðtÞ ¼ CO2FFI BCaOs2eFðFtÞI−BaCsOe2ðtFÞFI PolðtÞ where CO2FFI Pol(t) indicates the CO2 FFI emissions in the carbon tax case and CO2FFI Base(t) the emissions in the baseline at time t. We have focused on CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion and industry in the definition of the indicator because these emissions are captured by all energy-economy and integrated assessment models that are used for climate policy analysis. The choice ofa larger collection of greenhouse gases and sectors would have already excluded some models from the diagnostic analysis. In addition, the energy sector is the main venue for emission reductions [19], so key characteristics of the emissions response are captured by CO2 FFI emissions.",221.23121

It distinguishes three supply sectors: electricity generation, liquids production, and other non-electric energy supply (including hydrogen, gases and heat generation). Its derivation and the numerical results based on the survey of available technologies in the models are discussed in the SOM. Most models include a similarly high variety of low-carbon supply options, but some GE models include a noticeably lower number ofoptions. For simplicity, this measure focuses purely on energy supply side technologies and does not cover demand-side options for emissions reduction and use of low-carbon fuels (e.g., electricity or hydrogen in transport), even though demand side options are explicitly represented in some models and are important determinants of the ability of models to achieve low-carbon futures. Nonetheless, the measure illustrates the fact that by modeling the economy as a whole, GE models may not always include the same level of technological detail as more energy-system-focused PE models.

Table 4 gives an overview of direct mitigation costs of the climate policy of the major economic regions and key countries for the three carbon market cases. Columns (a) to (c) in Table 4 list the projected internal reduction costs experienced in 2020 while columns (d) to (f) give the cumulative costs over the period 2013 to 2020. These additional costs accrue from the introduction of a carbon price and the upfront investments necessary to achieve energy efficiency measures. Global costs are lowest for the option of the perfect carbon market. Yet even in the imperfect carbon market scenario, costs are substantially lower compared with the costs incurred where developed countries achieve all of the 30% reductions domestically. This confirms that gradually developing carbon markets can also contribute to a significant cost reduction. In order to estimate overall costs per region, both mitigation costs of reducing emissions from energy and non-CO2 emissions in industry (see table above) and potential costs and revenues related to trade flows in the carbon market need to be taken into account. Table 5 gives an overview of the costs incurred by various key countries. The first column represents the domestic reduction costs, while the second takes into account any additional costs from acquiring emission credits on the carbon market and revenues from selling emission credits on this market. The net transfers on the carbon market are $63 billion in total, including trade between developed countries. Trade between developed and developing represents net transfers of $47 billion. Developed countries benefit substantially from this trade with developing countries. Even though acquisition of the credits costs them $47 billion, their mitigation costs diminish by $105 billion, from $206 billion in the case ofno global trade to $101 billion with global trade (see Table 4). This represents a net gain of $58 billion. The cost of action undertaken by developing countries themselves without trade amounts to $60 billion in developing countries (Table 4). Offsetting mechanisms lead to higher emission reductions in developing countries compared to Case 3 with no global carbon market, consequently increasing the costs in developing countries from $60 billion in Case 3 to $88 billion in the original GA31 scenario. But in return for this cost increase of $28 billion, developing countries receive revenues worth $47 billion. In this way, emissions trading creates a significant reward of $19 billion over and above the costs incurred for increased emission reduction costs above the levels of own action foreseen in Case 3, potentially reducing the impact of own actions from $60 billion to $41 billion.  Offsetting mechanisms, such as sectoral no-lose targets, can thus be set at a level such that they ensure that developing countries undertake action on their own while at the same time partly compensating them for the incurred costs.",251.74533

A large variety of low-cost measures can be used in an early phase, most of which are already available and have negative or low costs even though the upfront investments may be considerable. All sectors have the potential for improvements in energy efficiency (in both supply and demand sectors). In all reduction cases, energy efficiency policies are assumed to be implemented. These policies, such as efficiency standards, are not price-induced, but nevertheless have a cost. The additional cost of the policy depends on the stringency of the standard.  Moreover, the gradual introduction of a carbon price for the sectors not covered by the ETS (transport, residential and services), which is higher than the one assumed in the baseline, stimulates further carbon price-induced improvements in energy efficiency. This additional incentive is only assumed in developed countries, simulating efficient policies across sectors. Fig. 10 shows the crucial importance of such induced energy efficiency improvements for the overall emission reductions, delivering up to 50% oftotal global effort compared to baseline in 2020 in the industrial sectors and in transport. In 2030 these still account for almost half the global effort. For developing countries the share is even higher, with about two-thirds of the total action coming from energy efficiency. In power generation, a large potential for cost-efficient improvements for various types of power plants exists, covering the full spectrum from combined cycle gas turbines to supercritical coal plants. Moreover, in developing countries, the coupling of energy improvements with air pollution abatement technologies could also generate significant health benefits.  Important efficiency gains can be reaped by improving the overall architecture of the power generation system and of the transmission and distribution grid, with effective integration of intermittent power sources like renewables or distributed generation like CHP. Smart grids, superconducting electric lines, and power storage devices such as pumping hydro are crucial technologies to realise these efficiency gains. Further, the industrial sector is the second most important source for energy efficiency improvements. These are potentially very large in emerging economies, especially in those whose economic growth is marked by a fast development of energy-intensive industries (typically true of China and other East Asian economies). Faster economic growth also fosters rapid capital equipment turnover, opening possibilities for adopting best available technologies (BAT).",251.7381

In this context, a scenario that would only see efforts by developing countries and Russia after 2030 (DP) could be interpreted as having a very low ambition on global participation, whereas the PM scenario could be seen as overly optimistic. Therefore, an intermediate scenario was added that describes a more gradual participation by both regions and sectors. Like the DP scenario, the GA is a delayed participation scenario leading to a suboptimal outcome compared to the PM scenario. However, the definitions applied in this scenario try to capture the type of action that could be perceived as appropriate for different countries and sectors in their stage of development. As such they are more complex. They imply a gradually evolving carbon market that sees the gradual penetration of a carbon price in different regions and sectors. The GA scenario does not assume perfect trading in all sectors across all time periods and regions. Thus, carbon prices do not equalise. It aims at representing a more realistic vision of how the carbon market may evolve while at the same time maintaining the idea of improving economic efficiency.  For the energy-intensive sectors, carbon prices within the group of OECD countries equalise by 2015, simulating that they all put in place ETS-type policy instruments that are linked. Economies in transition follow suit with carbon prices equalising with other developed countries' carbon price by 2020. Carbon prices in energy-intensive sectors in developing countries are lower but do exist from 2013 onwards. Energy-intensive sectors in developing countries are exposed to a lower carbon price starting from 2013, simulating the limited penetration or visibility of a carbon price for all individual firms through policy instruments such as the CDM. However, differences in the carbon prices become smaller over time as a result of a strengthened regulatory framework in close relationship with the state of development of the economy. Between 2025 and 2030, these differences in carbon prices become relatively smaller for all groups of countries apart from low-income countries. The left panel of Fig. 5 illustrates the price evolution in such a gradually developing carbon market. The carbon price level is calculated endogenously as an outcome of an emission target and defined accession times of the regions and sectors. Costs in this gradually developing carbon market will be higher than in the PM scenario but lower than in the DP scenario, due to differentiated participation already from 2013 on by all countries. The GA scenario assumes that transport, residential and services sectors do not participate in the global carbon market. Developed countries reduce emissions in these sectors through energy efficiency improvements and sector-specific policies. In developing countries, only energy efficiency policies are implemented in these sectors. In the beginning the price in the carbon market in the GA31 scenario is similar to that ofthe DP31 scenario (see the right panel ofFig. 5, which compares the carbon values for group 1 across scenarios) However, since not all regions and sectors participate from the beginning and thus emissions are higher, the carbon price must later increase by more to reduce emissions enough to meet the radiative forcing target (see emission pathways in Fig. 2.).",251.741094

Since a forcing level of 3.7 W/m2 has a very low probability ofreaching this target and the low 2.6 W/m2 forcing level has a very high probability (but could not be simulated), an intermediate radiative forcing target was added to the analysis. The following sections focus on scenarios that lead to a radiative forcing of 3.1 W/m211 with a 50% chance of limiting the temperature increase to 2 °C above pre-industrial levels. Fig. 2 shows the global emissions of the Kyoto gases (in CO2-equivalents) and the corresponding forcing levels for all ofthe scenarios. A forcing target of 4.5 W/m2 allows the emissions to grow significantly until approximately 2040, whereas to achieve 3.1 W/m2 global emissions have to peak around 2020. Fig. 3 shows the GHG emission for group 1. For this country group emissions can be kept on the same level only at an ambition level corresponding to a forcing of 4.5 W/m2. For lower radiative forcing levels immediate reduction of emissions for group 1 is necessary. Delayed action by the other groups means that the emissions for group 1 for an ambition level of 3.7 W/m2 (DP37) are almost identical as the much more stringent 3.1 W/m2, assuming a perfect market (PM31). Also, the restriction of not allowing radiative forcing to overshoot 3.7 W/m2 (PM37NO) produces an emission trajectory for group 1 that is very close to the PM31 scenario. Fig. 4 shows the primary energy shares for 2050 for the baseline and the different radiative forcing target levels assuming a perfect market (PM). There is a clear shift away from carbon-intensive fuels (coal) towards carbon-free energy sources (renewables, nuclear). A considerable part of the remaining coal is used in combination with carbon capture and storage (CCS). At the same time, total consumption is reduced with increasing ambition levels.",251.14842

POLES is a global simulation model of the energy system. The dynamics of the model is based on a recursive (year-by-year) simulation process of energy demand and supply with lagged adjustments to prices and a feedback loop through the international energy price. The model is developed in the framework of a hierarchical structure of interconnected modules at the international, regional, and national levels. It contains technologically-detailed modules for energy-intensive sectors, including power generation, iron and steel, the chemical sector, aluminium production, cement making, non-ferrous minerals and modal transport sectors (including aviation and maritime transport). All energy prices are determined endogenously. Oil prices in the long-term depend primarily on the relative scarcity of oil reserves  (i.e. the ratio of reserve to production). The world is broken down into 47 regions, for which the model delivers detailed energy balances. The model is continuously being enhanced in both detail and in the degree of regional disaggregation. Recent modifications include the addition of detailed modules for energy-intensive sectors (see, e.g. Szabó et al., 2006) and an extension to cover non-CO2 greenhouse gases (GHG) (see Criqui et al., 2006).",251.79775

Besides looking at the different levels ofradiative forcing as defined in the EMF study, in this paper we add an additional radiative forcing level corresponding to the 2 °C target, which thereby is considered to add interesting information to policy discussions. This analysis also tries to extend beyond the stylised EMF scenarios on participation, which define either a perfect global carbon market or delayed participation with no offsetting mechanisms between developed and developing countries until the middle of the century. The extension is done by adding an intermediate policy scenario to the analysis that gradually incorporates all countries' efforts, taking into account their ability to contribute from 2013 onwards. Section 2 of the paper describes the modelling tools applied in this study. Section 3 presents the baseline. Section 4 addresses several stylised climate change scenarios (perfect global action or delayed action by developing countries resulting in similar long-term radiative forcing) and an additional intermediate policy scenario in which developing country participation already starts in 2013 in a gradual manner and is reinforced through a gradually developing global carbon market. Out of the set of scenarios Section 5 focuses on those in line with the 2 °C target. The gradual action scenario and the associated costs are presented in detail in Section 6.

This study explored near- to intermediate-term policies to address climate change using formal energy-economic and integrated assessment (IA) models. The goal of EMF 22 was to construct a high-quality, coordinated set of policy scenarios using state of the art models to inform ongoing and upcoming climate policy discussions. In particular, EMF 22 focused on moving away from idealized policy scenarios, which have been the primary focus of international modeling, toward scenarios that are more representative ofreal policy discussions today. EMF 22 was constructed with three distinct subgroups: an international subgroup, a U.S. subgroup, and an E.U. subgroup. Each of these subgroups made a specific set of coordinated model runs, providing comparability across models in an exploration of issues of significant interest. Individual modeling teams then conducted explorations of additional issues based on their interests and strengths. In total, 17 models participated in EMF 22; several models participated in more than one subgroup. This issue contains 18 individual papers from the 17 modeling teams.  In addition, the issue contains three overview papers, one for each subgroup. Each of these overview papers summarizes the study design for the subgroup and provides an overview of key results across the models. The work of the EMF 22 international subgroup is covered in a set of eleven papers. The EMF 22 international scenarios engaged ten IA models to study the combined implications of three key factors in international climate negotiations: (1) the long-term climate-related target, expressed in this study in terms of the CO2-equivalent (CO2-e) concentration associated with the GHGs regulated under the Kyoto Protocol, (2) whether or not this target can be temporarily exceeded prior to 2100 (“overshoot”) allowing for greater near-term flexibility, and (3) the extent and timing ofinternational participation in emissions mitigation. The EMF 22 international scenarios are based on combinations of these factors, embodied in ten specific climate-action cases that all modeling groups in the study attempted to represent. The EMF 22 international scenarios took a long-term perspective, exploring these ten climate-action cases through 2100. The EMF 22 U.S. scenarios are covered in the second set ofsix papers in this special issue.  The EMF 22 U.S. scenarios engaged six models that considered three stylized emissions goals through 2050. These emissions goals were designed to bracket a range of potential U.S. climate policy goals. The three emissions goals were defined by the cumulative emissions associated with linear emissions pathways for the period from 2012 to 2050 that begin at the 2008 emissions level, followed by either: (1) a constant annual level through 2050; (2) a path falling to 50% below 1990 levels by 2050; or (3) a path falling to 80% below 1990 levels by 2050. The EMF 22 E.U. scenarios are covered in the final set offour papers in this special issue. The EMF 22 E.U. scenarios engaged three models to explore the economic implications of several stylized versions of components of the E.U. plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 20% below their 1990 levels by 2020. The study was constructed, in particular, to explore the implications of (1) separating sectors into Emissions Trading Sectors (ETS) and non-ETS sectors and (2) a 20% renewable energy target for 2020. Six mitigation scenarios were constructed to explore these dimensions of E.U. policy, ranging from an idealized scenario in which all sectors are included in the ETS to a scenario that includes more realistic representations of the ETS and non-ETS sectors along with the renewable energy target. This summary of findings and the collection of papers in this special issue are an important body ofwork that provides insights into the implications of alternative decisions relevant to U.S., E.U, and international policy-making. EMF 22 is also important for the collection of primary model outputs created by the participating modeling teams and archived in the EMF 22 data base (http://emf. stanford.edu/). By creating and populating a data base with assumptions and results from many of the world's leading modeling teams, EMF 22 has created a data base of quantitative model outputs that should provide a foundation of knowledge to inform policy-making today and in the years ahead. We are grateful to the EMF sponsors, the modeling teams, and the paper writers for making this all possible.",251.73632

In case the short-term emission target is higher than the emissions with full ‘when’-flexibility the scenario is indicated by bold fond (taken from Figure S1). Note that positive and negative components of each scenario do not necessarily add up to zero. The amplification ratio is given on the right side ofthe plot. It is defined as the sum ofabsolute values oflong-term components put into relation with the sum of the positive short-term components. 11 The model DNE21+ is an exception, because it calibrates paremeters to match the relatively high prices currently observed in the market. The initial calibration of prices means that the reasons behind the prices are not represented explicitly and therefore climate policies do not have a strong effect on these prices. 13 In this section we use the scenarios computed within work-package 3 of the AMPERE project. Here, the GDP assumptions were harmonized to meet similar economic development levels. Hence, GHG intensity improvements lead to similar—though not equal—emission limitation trajectories. 14 In case of strict quantity targets the effects of carbon leakage would be simply excluded because it would not allow the possibility that CO2 emissions go above the levels of the reference policy case.",466.26544

The diverse nature of these integrated assessment models highlights large uncertainties in the likely development offossil resource (coal, oil, and natural gas) consumption, trade, and prices over the course ofthe twenty-first century and under different climate policy frameworks. We explore and explain some of the differences across scenarios and models and compare the scenario results with fossil resource estimates from the literature. A robust finding across the suite ofIAMs is that the cumulative fossil fuel consumption foreseen by the models is well within the bounds of estimated recoverable reserves and resources found in the literature. A corollary conclusion deriving from this finding is that fossil resource constraints are, in and ofthemselves, unlikely to limit future GHG emissions and, thus, global climate change this century. Moreover, while the models show that fossil fuel consumption–especially of coal–must decrease strongly to achieve either a 550 or 450 ppm CO2-eq climate stabilization target, there appears to be no agreement on the individual contributions from coal, oil, and gas, as this depends on a number ofother factors simultaneously influencing climate mitigation, such as the cost and deployment ofnon-fossil technologies and the utilization ofCCS, as well as non-CO2 emissions and mitigation in the non-energy sectors (e.g., afforestation). Energy demand growth will also be an important determinant in future fossil use, though one point on which all models agree is that energy efficiency/conservation cannot on its own provide the required reductions in fossil fuel use that are needed to protect the global climate. Our analysis ofthe implications ofclimate policies for regional expenditures on fossil fuels and carbon shows that such policies could lead to a major reallocation of financial flows between regions. Although the costs of carbon will be non-negligible in a low-carbon future, countries of ASIA and the OECD90 may be able to partially offset them through reduced oil and gas import expenditures. Major exporting regions (MAF, LAM, REF) regions, on the other hand, will lose out on key export revenue streams. The changing face of global energy trade will also have a marked impact on near-term energy security concerns. In baseline scenarios, these concerns are likely to rise over the next two decades in ASIA and the OECD90. Policy efforts focused on mitigating climate change can alleviate these concerns to some extent via the reductions in oil imports (sovereignty) and increases in energy system diversity (resilience) they will help to motivate. Contrary to the stated objectives of certain countries, however, aggressive efforts to promote energy efficiency are, on their own, not likely to lead to markedly greater energy independence. Moreover, an important, and growing, energy security concern (in both baseline and carbon-constrained futures) is likely to be the increasing concentration ofoil and gas exports in just two producing regions – that is, unless policies in importing countries explicitly target the sources of their imports. Given the uncertainties mentioned herein, further research is needed to improve our collective understanding of the full equilibrium effects of energy efficiency and climate policies on fossil energy markets.",346.958083

These developments are likely to only exacerbate energy security concerns along the sovereignty dimension. Energy and climate policies can play a role, however, in shifting the balance between imported vs. domestic (i.e., produced within the region) oil consumption. The suite of EMF27 models show that under scenarios of stringent climate mitigation (450 FullTech), wherein total oil demand in 2030 is generally lower, absolute oil imports into the OECD90 and ASIA in 2030 are likely to be lower as well (Fig. 4). This finding is broadly similar to those of Jewell et al. (2013b), who conduct a cross-model comparison and analyze four major economies. At the same time, the share of total oil consumption being met by imports remains at roughly the same level as in the baseline. This indicates that both domestic and imported oil (primarily from the countries of the Middle East and Africa, MAF, or the reformed countries of the former Soviet Union, REF, including Russia and the Caspian region) are cut in roughly equal quantities–an outcome with important economic and policy implications. The ability of stringent climate mitigation efforts to generate near-term synergies for energy security derives from both energy efficiency improvements (beyond those foreseen in the baseline) and shifts to non-fossil based energy forms (e.g., renewables, which in most cases are inherently sovereign and thus secure) (McCollum et al. 2011; Riahi et al. 2012). However, focusing on energy efficiency and conservation measures alone (Base LowEI) – in the absence of an overarching carbon policy framework – is not likely to bear security benefits of the same magnitude. As illustrated in Fig. 4, compared to baseline levels, oil imports (whether in absolute or relative terms) into the OECD90 and ASIA are only marginally reduced, if at all. Why? Primarily because efficiency measures are likely to drive out higher-cost supplies of both domestic and imported oil, assuming competitive markets are at play.  Such a robust finding across the models does not unequivocally support the stated objectives of certain industrialized countries, where energy efficiency (e.g., improved fuel economy standards for road vehicles) has often been touted as major step toward achieving energy independence.  In short, while efficiency measures are critical, they would need to be complemented by either security- or climate-focused policies to have maximal impact. Exactly where all of this imported oil (and gas) originates will of course not be lost on the countries bringing it across their borders. Today’s oil and gas export markets are dominated by the countries comprising the MAF and REF regions; together these energy producers account for more than 90 % of global trade. It is perhaps no wonder that oligopolistic markets this concentrated have some importers concerned (resilience dimension). According to the EMF27 models, these concerns show no signs of diminishing in the near-to-medium term. In fact, as measured by the Shannon-Wiener diversity index (SWDI; see “Supplementary Material”), global oil and gas export markets are likely to become even more concentrated over the next two decades (i.e., lower geographic supply diversity) in the baseline scenario. For gas in particular, the market in 2030 could even reach a diversification level that is far less than today’s market for oil (see Fig. 5 in SM), a finding also noted by Jewell et al. (2013a). Policies promoting energy efficiency and decarbonization do not appear able to improve this situation to any measurable degree.  A recent study by Cherp et al. (2013) on this topic finds that climate policies could decrease the geographic diversity of oil- and coal- producing regions.",346.89554

Yet, not all regions will be affected the same by these developments. As discussed in Section 3, some will fare better than others, depending on their resource endowments. This could potentially lead to concerns over energy security in certain regions. This section complements the earlier discussions of this paper by linking the fossil resource and energy security dynamics displayed by the models. To be sure, none of the EMF27 scenarios are explicitly driven by normative targets for security (e.g., import dependence); rather, we illustrate here the security implications of policies promoting energy efficiency and decarbonization. Unlike other discussions in this paper, the focus is shifted to the near term (2030), since this is the timeframe in which energy security is typically discussed in policy circles. Energy security concerns can be categorized along three dimensions: sovereignty, resilience, and robustness (Cherp et al. 2012; Cherp and Jewell 2011). We only focus on the first two in this paper, concentrating specifically on oil and gas. Sovereignty relates to the degree of control national governments have over their energy systems; resilience describes the ability of energy systems to respond to disruptions. Recent years have seen growing dependence of the OECD, and increasingly Asian countries, on imported oil and gas (sovereignty) from a limited number of suppliers (resilience). And while renewables and gas have made major inroads in energy systems across the world over the past decades, there is still a marked lack of diversity in energy supply in most regions and/or sectors, such as transport, where readily available substitutes are lacking in the short term (resilience). Use of oil, especially imported oil, tends to be the most oft-cited energy security concern of today’s (and tomorrow’s) major importing regions, the OECD90 and ASIA.  As a group, OECD90 countries imported approximately 39 EJ of their oil from other regions in 2010 roughly 55 % of all oil consumption (see Fig. 4). The share of oil imports in ASIA is currently about the same, albeit out of a much smaller total level of oil consumption (20 EJ). Economic and energy demand growth in the latter group is projected to be considerably more rapid over the next decades; in a baseline scenario (Base FullTech) this is likely to translate to a multi-fold increase in oil consumption by 2030. According to the EMF27 models, most of that demand will be met by imports: Fig. 4 shows that across the models the share of oil imports in ASIA could grow to more than 80 % (median value; interquartile range: 70–90 %) within only two decades.

Meanwhile, the reductions in coal and gas expenditures are more minor. The force behind these dynamics is a gradual shift away from oil in the middle of the century, as and then gas later in the century, in favor of lower-priced coal supplies. Coal is used in great quantities for power production, particularly in ASIA, and in some models for liquid transportation fuels, thus replacing oil. Climate policy has a pronounced impact on this situation, especially for coal. The impact on oil is more pronounced in the second period. This is due to the relative inelasticity of oil demand (compared to other fuels) in most models and is indicative of the inertia of the global transport system, which is almost completely dependent on oil at present, in response to constraints on carbon. Finally, expenditures on gas are not greatly affected by climate policy in the first half of the century, which is explained by the fact that gas tends be a short- to mid-term transitional solution for mitigating emissions. The fuel’s carbon content eventually becomes a handicap, however, when deeper emission reductions must be made; thus, gas expenditures decrease more significantly after 2050.",345.981262

This is why Fig. 3 explicitly compares the magnitude of expenditures on carbon to those of oil and gas imports–or to the corresponding loss of export revenues in the case of fossil fuel producing regions. ASIA and the OECD90 together account for the bulk of carbon expenditures between now and 2050, with around $30 trillion cumulative of fiscal revenues (median across models; range: $12–100 trillion). At the same time, these regions—being net energy importers in all models in the first half of the century—are also the two that benefit the most from climate policy, in terms of the reductions in oil trade that decarbonization promotes (see also Section 4). Yet, the gain from a decrease in oil import expenditures is still lower than the amount spent on carbon expenditures. The main exporters over the first half of the century (LAM, MAF, REF) all see decreasing oil exports by value. Natural gas, on the other hand, displays a different trend than for oil. Expenditures on gas imports increase for ASIA under stringent climate policy (median result; some models anticipate a decrease), primarily due to the substitution of gas (with CCS) for coal in power generation. Although not obvious in the figure, the REF region seems to benefit the most from this situation, exporting more to ASIA.",345.93301

In the event of a global regime to mitigate climate change, fossil resource trade will be especially affected, while simultaneously the market for CO2 as a commodity will grow by several orders of magnitude. This section compares the evolution of regional carbon expenditures (calculated as the product of CO2 emissions from fossil fuels and industry and carbon price) with total fossil fuel expenditures and with expenditures/revenues for oil and gas imports/exports in the 450 FullTech and Base FullTech scenarios. We focus upon these specific metrics because for energy-importing regions carbon pricing policies will, depending on implementation, redirect financial flows back into the local economy.  Pursuant to the EMF27 study design, the carbon price in the 450 FullTech climate stabilization scenario is globally harmonized (i.e., no regional differentiation and no carbon trade). Burden-sharing is outside the scope of this paper, though other IAM inter-comparison exercises have looked into these important issues (Tavoni et al. 2013). Note that due to varying regional definitions across the EMF27 models, the analysis described here is applied at the level of the five RCP aggregation regions (van Vuuren et al. 2011)7: ASIA, LAM (Latin America), MAF (Middle East and Africa), OECD90, REF (Reforming Economies). The graphical panels of Fig. 3 compare regional expenditures (on a cumulative basis) across models for the two scenarios. All expenditures are shown as differences between the climate policy scenario (450 FullTech) and the baseline (Base FullTech), which assumes no climate policy and thus carbon expenditures of zero. By expressing net oil and gas import expenditures in monetary terms, both price and consumption effects are accounted for. A negative value indicates that import expenditures are lower in the 450 FullTech scenario than in the Base FullTech; this would represent, ceteris paribus, a gain compared to the baseline for the importing region. On the other hand, a positive value indicates that export revenues are lower as a result of climate policy; this would represent a loss compared to the baseline for the exporting region. In addition, the tabular panel of Fig. 3 presents cumulative global fossil expenditures (not only trade) as a share of globally-aggregated gross domestic product (GDP) for the same two scenarios. Note that these expenditures are calculated based on international fuel prices and therefore exclude national fiscal policies (including carbon prices) and other mark-ups (distribution costs, profits, etc.). For reference, fossil fuel expenditures over the past several years have amounted to roughly 5 % of global GDP.",345.892943

Because of the lower demand for fossil fuels that climate policies will motivate, fossil prices are, in general, lower in the 450 FullTech scenario. There are marked differences in price developments across models, however, as well as between fuels.

Figure 1 illustrates these differences by showing, for a given scenario, the large range of total fossil fuel consumption that is calculated by the various models. (Note that coal, oil, and gas consumption is broken out separately in Fig. 1 ofthe SM.) Despite the uncertainty, however, a fairly robust trend across the models is that in the baseline scenario (Base FullTech), which is built on reference energy demand growth projections, fossil fuels are likely to continue to dominate the energy mix for the foreseeable future (55–80 ZJ from 2010 to 2100). Yet, even in the highest scenarios in our set, cumulative consumption is well below the estimated amount oftotal fossil resource available (405–695 ZJ; see Table 1). On a fuel-by-fuel basis, this is also the case (see “Supplementary Material”), especially for coal, a fuel that is massively deployed in the baseline scenarios of several models (e.g., MERGE), though one for which the resource base is extremely large. For oil and gas, this would mean eventually tapping into more costly, unconventional resources and reserves. As an example, no more than 25 ZJ ofoil is consumed between 2010 and 2100 across the models in any scenario (see “Supplementary Material”); and while this level is well within the range of total oil estimated to be available globally (24 ZJ to 74 ZJ),1 it is considerably larger than the amount of conventional oil (9 ZJ to 14 ZJ).2 An important conclusion deriving from the comparison of EMF27 model results to the resource estimates of the literature is that fossil resource constraints are, in and of themselves, unlikely to limit future GHG emissions and, thus, global climate change during the twenty-first century. This is shown clearly in Fig. 1 (Panel (a)) by noting how the size of the global fossil resource base (based on values in Table 1) far exceeds the levels of fossil consumption that are expected by 2100 according to the models. Interestingly, this also seems to be the case in even higher energy demand futures, such as the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 8.5 scenario (Riahi et al. 2011), which has also been added to the figure for comparison.  Panel (c) further makes the point by showing the cumulative emissions of CO2 in both the EMF27 and RCP scenarios and comparing them to the emissions that would hypothetically be realized if the world’s reserves and resources of coal, oil, and gas were each combusted in their entirety. Clearly, none of the scenarios come anywhere close to this potentially high quantity, an amount that is off the chart shown here but could easily reach into the tens of thousands of gigatonnes (Gt) of CO2. (Note that in some scenarios cumulative emissions do approach those strictly from reserves. This is because the models consume a mixture of reserves and resources for coal and oil; see SM.) These results across a suite of IAMs appear to contradict those of other recent studies (e.g., Ward et al. (2012) and Höök and Tang (2013)), which argue that fossil resource scarcity will ultimately be a limiting factor in GHG emissions growth. Such studies assert that IAM scenario estimates for future fossil fuel production are too optimistic. Aggressive energy efficiency and decarbonization efforts will naturally lead to major reductions in fossil resource consumption compared to the baseline scenarios. This is illustrated by the 550 FullTech and 450 FullTech scenarios in Fig. 1. Interestingly, the reductions exhibited in these scenarios are, for nearly all models, larger than those observed in the Base LowEI (low energy demand) scenario. That is, as a stand-alone climate mitigation strategy, energy efficiency and conservation cannot on its own provide the required large reductions in fossil fuel use that are needed to stabilize the global climate at either 550 or 450 ppm CO2-eq.  What the models do show, in contrast, is that in order to achieve stabilization, the ultimately permissible amount of fossil consumption depends to a large extent on the utilization of carbon capture and storage (CCS) (Panel b of Fig. 1), for which a number of technical and socio-political challenges still remain to be overcome (IPCC 2005). The climate targets can in most cases be met without CCS (not shown here, instead see Krey et al. (2013)), but then other issues and concerns could arise, with respect to renewable resource availability, reliance on nuclear power, and so on. To be sure, there is a large spread in fossil CCS deployment across models for a given scenario.  In the 450 FullTech, for example, 20-85 % of cumulative coal consumption is in combination with CCS, while the range is 15-50 % for gas. These differences lead to varying estimates for the total volume of CO2 that must be geologically stored (see Box 1). Note that models deploy fossil CCS technologies in varying quantities because of the heterogeneous suites of mitigation measures represented within them, including renewables (Luderer and Krey 2013), bio-energy (Rose et al. 2013a), afforestation (Popp et al. 2013), and non-GHG emissions (Rose et al. 2013b). Furthermore, differences in model structure and solution framework affect the flexibility of models to reduce energy demand and to substitute other fuels in the energy supply (see “Supplementary Material” for further explanation).",345.97455

Total available resources ofoil (at all cost steps) range from 19 zettajoules (MERGE) to levels several times higher (GRAPE), depending on whether unconventional oil resources and reserves are included, whether additional occurrences of oil that are not economically or technically viable today are considered, and how exactly the oil supply curves are incorporated into the models.

On the one hand, the availability and geographic distribution of fossil fuels will largely dictate energy trade patterns. On the other hand, changes in fossil fuel prices will have important implications for the affordability of energy in the near-to-midterm, and perhaps equally important, impact the potential of alternative energy options to diffuse into the market. The availability and price of fossil fuels are therefore not only important drivers of the carbon intensity of the future energy system, they are also critical determinants of the costs of climate change mitigation. In this paper we analyze a multi-model ensemble of long-term energy and emissions scenarios that were developed within the framework of the Energy Modeling Forum 27 (EMF27) model inter-comparison exercise. The diverse nature of these integrated assessment models (IAM), including their underlying assumptions, highlights large uncertainties in the likely development of fossil resource (coal, oil, and natural gas) consumption and prices over the course of the twenty-first century. We explore and explain some of the differences across scenarios and models and compare the scenario results with fossil resource estimates from studies in the literature. In particular, we address the question of whether or not physical resource availability is likely to be a limiting factor for future greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and, thus, climate change. Previous reviews (e.g., Höök and Tang (2013)) have found that the literature remains sparse on this issue. Similarly, we survey the literature that assesses the world’s capacity for geological storage of carbon dioxide (CO2) and put these estimates into the context of what is shown by the EMF27 models, again in an attempt to identify potential constraints on this “resource” base. Moreover, because the deployment of fossil fuels differs markedly in scenarios that assume stringent climate policies compared to those without, we also compare resource consumption and price trends in both of these types of scenarios. Implications of climate policies for regional expenditures on fossil fuels are explicitly analyzed, and the results are put into a future perspective by relating them to potential expenditures for carbon mitigation. Finally, we introduce simple indicators for exploring the regional energy security implications of climate policy, with a particular emphasis on import dependency and energy system diversity–proxies for the sovereignty and resilience of the future energy system–as proposed in Jewell et al. (2013b). In carrying out the analyses described above, we focus on only a subset of the EMF27 scenarios. These scenarios, which are referred to throughout the paper, are briefly described below.

Our analysis also shows that climate mitigation policies could lead to a major reallocation of financial flows between regions, in terms of expenditures on fossil fuels and carbon, and can help to alleviate near-term energy security concerns via the reductions in oil imports and increases in energy system diversity they will help to motivate.

As a rule-of-thumb, the average cost of CO2 transport is $7-8/tCO2 and the average cost of CCS is $24-26/tCO2 in most time periods.",453.84448

However, given the large quantity of CO2 captured at FT-diesel biorefineries, the abatement cost in $/GJ biofuel is relatively large ($2-5/GJ), meaning that CCS has a much larger impact on fuel prices at FT-diesel plants than it does at cellulosic ethanol plants. This finding is confirmed by the MinCO2 scenario in which the cellulosic ethanol plants have much smaller $/GJ abatement costs ($1-2/GJ) than the FT-diesel plants (Fig. 19). However, this scenario also indicates that the $/tCO2 abatement costs are significantly larger and less stable for cellulosic ethanol plants with a range between $25 and $175/tCO2 in later time periods. By sorting plants according to their abatement costs, Fig. 19 also clearly illustrates that cellulosic ethanol plants contribute a small share of the total CO2 captured in each time period.

In addition, even though biodiesel plants provide ~83% of the biofuel supply in MinCO2, they account for ~99% of the negative emissions. This reinforces the fact that the higher capture efficiency of FT-diesel plants allows them to be much more effective in achieving negative emissions than cellulosic ethanol plants.

Thus, increasing the CO2 price largely impacts the quantity of competitive biofuel with CCS in the intermediate years (2030 and 2040). Moreover, the CO2 prices in the GHG10 scenario seem sufficient for rendering the majority of biofuel supply with CCS economical in 2030 and beyond.

Thus, if all plants that lie above the fuel price were not built, it is likely that the cost of CO2 transport would increase for the lower cost plants. Consequently, it is unclear whether this small amount of supply would remain competitive. Incidentally, the biorefineries sited in 2020 would not be competitive even without CCS. However, most of the biofuel production would be competitive in 2030 without CCS. In 2040 and 2050, most of the biofuel supply with CCS is competitive with conventional fuels even without a CO2 price.

The contribution of injection is simple since it is a fixed $5/tCO2 captured. However, the transport cost is a bit more complicated since a plant may be one of many on a large integrated regional network. To identify biorefinery-specific transport costs, we make two assumptions: 1) all plants are responsible for the cost of their own connection to the network (i.e., non-shared pipelines) and 2) the cost of all shared pipelines are distributed over the biorefineries on each network. In other words, all plants on a network pay a fixed rate per tonne CO2 to cover the cost of the shared network. Given the cost of transport for each biorefinery, biofuel supply and abatement cost curves can be generated at each time step.

The first scenario, entitled “MinCO2”, requires only that the biofuel with CCS target is met and mimics the case in which policy-makers mandate the addition of CCS to all new biofuel plants, but without providing any incentive for maximizing the CO2 captured (i.e., no carbon price). As a result, we expect the model to prefer biofuel production technologies that minimize the CO2 captured per unit of fuel (e.g., ethanol production) since less investment into CCS infrastructure is required. The second scenario, entitled “MaxCO2”, requires that the biofuel target is met while maximizing the CO2 captured per unit of fuel. Consequently, we expect this scenario to prefer Fischer-Tropsch (FT) diesel production since more CO2 per unit of fuel can be captured. Essentially, this scenario mimics the case in which the carbon price exceeds the levelized cost of CCS (i.e., once producers can make money from each unit of CO2 captured, they will try to maximize the CO2 captured per unit of fuel). Thus, for a given biofuel with CCS target, these two scenarios represent the two extremes of CCS infrastructure investment. The first scenario effectively minimizes CO2 capture, and thus CCS investment, while the second scenario maximizes these parameters. For example, the MaxCO2 scenario captures ~650 Mt CO2/year in 2050 while the MinCO2 scenario captures ~540 Mt CO2/year. Consequently, these scenarios provide insight into the types of technologies deployed, the potential for negative emissions, and the cost of mitigating emissions under these extremes.",455.236515

The “blue” scenarios can be interpreted of a succession of policy shocks with no formation of credible policy signals.

The magnitude of the cost as revealed by the modeling exercise can be explained by the interaction between the energy-economy system and the choice of policy instruments for climate mitigation within the modeling framework of Imaclim-R. Imaclim-R models market imperfections, inertia, short-run adjustments constraints and imperfect expectations, which may induce higher costs than in the case of inter-temporal optimization with perfect foresight (Fisher et al. 2007). The sole policy instrument used in the EMF27 study is a uniform CO2 tax imposed on CO2 emissions from fossil fuels use. A single price signal may be suited to first-best modeling frameworks. However, in the case of imperfect markets (including imperfect labor markets) and imperfect foresight, the absence of accompanying instruments such as policies inducing a shift in investments towards public transportation infrastructure (Waisman et al. 2012a), labor policies (Guivarch et al. 2011) may partly explain the high macroeconomic cost of climate mitigation. In this setting, the Imaclim-R World model takes as an input a given yearly emissions trajectory, abiding by the emissions constraints provided in the EMF27 protocol. Since Imaclim-R World is a recursive dynamic model, each year, the economy is subject to this emission constraint and a carbon tax is found to meet this constraint. There is however no optimization of the trajectory as a whole: the carbon value is therefore not only determined by the yearly constraint, but also by the state of the economy caused by past decisions. The carbon tax is therefore path-dependent. In addition, in the regular setting, agents are myopic by nature, especially with regards to carbon prices, and do not expect a rise in carbon prices due to more stringent concerns in the future. This myopia, in conjunction with inertia, is a first cause for a second-best economy. This first setting is represented by the blue curves. Consequently, we implemented another expectations formation system in which agents anticipate carbon prices as a result of a better price signal following the goverments’ annoucements. In this second setting, since agents adapt their behavior to take into account expected carbon prices, their myopia does not prevent them from using technologies more suited to the future carbon constraints. Consequently, the red curves will improve adaptability to climate policies. The imperfections of labor markets are another cause of the second-best economy. Imaclim-R World represents rigidities in labor and wages adjustments, causing climate policies to be potentially more problematic than in a first best scenario, especially in the case of a suboptimal fiscal system. One way of starting to solve this issue is to alleviate the burden on labor by redirecting the additional government income from the carbon tax towards lowering labor taxes. This recycling scheme, in addition to the improvement in carbon price expectations, will constitute the third set of scenarios, in yellow. Finally, because of the strong inertia in capital, notably in infrastructures, installed long-lived capital might be ill-suited to an increased stringency of the carbon constraint. The final setting will therefore add to the previous scenarios an improvement in infrastructure installations, obeying other signals than prices. This setting will be shown in green.",346.085887

However, in the longer term, economies may be locked in an electricity mix that greatly depends on fossil fuels. The unavailability of CCS combined with the low availability of biomass resources induce high costs in the long term. Without CCS, the availability of biomass for electricity and transportation proves to be a robust technology option to decrease long term costs. Climate mitigation costs are driven by the increase in energy prices propagating across the economy. For instance, when CCS is unavailable, limited biomass resources lead to high carbon prices, resulting in a high energy share in production costs in all sectors, which increases the consumer price index and induces high macroeconomic costs. The use of biomass for energy purposes greatly affects the price of agricultural goods, which may prove unsustainable. The amount of land required for bioenergy production also shows the possible unsustainability of climate mitigation scenarios that may rely too heavily on biomass. Early action greatly reduces the requirement for biomass and allows reducing long term economic costs, to the detriment of the short term.

One favored option here may be to adjust the timing of mitigation efforts. Here we shed light on what a robust strategy might be, looking at both long-term goals and short-term constraints. In order to assess the impact of the timing of mitigation efforts on the cost profile and on required bioenergy and land, two emission profiles are tested (Fig. 3a), both corresponding to RCP 3.7. For each trajectory, 18 scenarios are run according to a wide range of assumptions about technology and resource availability and development patterns.  The time profiles are obtained by averaging these results. The late action trajectory, identical to the emissions constraint used in the first part of the study, imposes relatively weak efforts in the short term but stringent efforts in the longer term. By contrast, the early action trajectory translates into stronger efforts in the short term, allowing for less stringent efforts in the longer term to reach the same carbon budget. The levels of stringency of both trajectories are comparable in the medium term. The early action trajectory leads to the earlier penetration of biomass and requires less than half the negative emissions than the delayed action scenario (15 GtCO2 vs. 35 GtCO2 on Fig. 3b). The lowest point on each curve corresponds to the maximum required production rate in EJ/year, which determines the required land area for bioenergy production. The maximum production rate and land requirement are smaller in the early action case, showing that early action can act as a hedge against the risk that available land for energy crop production may be over-estimated, for instance if expected agricultural yield improvements are not met.",345.862243

The large scale production of biomass for energy may generate emissions from deforestation and agricultural intensification and adversely impact food prices. Moreover, the sustainability of biomass resource use should be assessed when reporting and accounting for emissions (International Energy Agency 2011). Biomass for electricity production may be produced from unsustainable sources in non-Annex I countries, used in Annex I countries and therefore accounted for as a sustainable fuel. To address this issue, biomass for electricity is assumed to grow on abandoned land (i.e. not forest), which means that the figure used for available land area used to grow biomass for energy purposes should assume no deforestation. This further raises the issue of expected yield improvements, as the available area of abandoned land may not be sufficient to meet bioenergy demand. Several studies assess the environmental impact and sustainability of biomass resources. The uncertainty on yield improvements translates into uncertainty on sustainable bioenergy availability. Haberl et al. (2010) suggest that managed forests are expected to bring the highest yields in 2050: 149 GJ/ha/year, with a reported variability between 69 and 600 GJ/ha/year. With this assumption, the production of 300 EJ/year of biomass worldwide (which is the highest observed value in the results) would require a land area of 2.01 Gha, corresponding to about 15 % of total land area. The additional contribution of residues would be up to 100 EJ. This estimate still leads to around 10 % of total land area. Furthermore, Fritz et al. (2013) report the availability of up to 1.035 Gha (all resources included). The purpose here is not to discuss the value itself, but to emphasize that these levels of dedicated land might prove unsustainable. The order of magnitude at stake here could suggest an unsustainable level of biomass use. The influence of the increasing use of bioenergy on agricultural markets is captured through the price of agricultural goods. The explicit interaction between land rents, land competition and farming production choices would likely increase agricultural prices, hence higher mitigation costs.  We focus here on the impact of bioenergy use on the economy-energy system and look for ways to reduce bioenergy (and land) requirement considering the possible unsustainability of bioenergy production.",346.075666

With CCS, the decarbonized economy can continue to rely on fossil fuels. BECCS largely contributes to decarbonizing the economy through negative emissions. In the long term, electricity prices and the share of energy in production costs return to baseline levels, which limits the CPI increase and allows for moderate policy costs. In the absence of CCS however, electricity and transportation rely heavily on biomass to meet the carbon constraint. With limited biomass availability, high carbon prices are required to meet the constraint. In that case, high electricity and agriculture prices increase the weight of energy in production costs, hence a high CPI and low consumption. Therefore, biomass is crucial to limit long term policy costs in the absence of CCS. We examine each step in turn. After 2050, the trends described previously continue for the electricity mix (Appendix I): reliance on fossil fuels with CCS when available, or reliance on nuclear, intermittent renewables and biomass combined with lower demand when CCS is unavailable. In the scenarios with CCS, fossil fuels with CCS supply half the electricity production, renewables a third. Bioelectricity production is very low, but always occurs in combination with CCS. Even though bioelectricity production is low, it contributes up to −1.5 GtCO2/yr (respectively −2.5 GtCO2/yr) of negative emissions in the low (respectively high) biomass potential scenario. This is a first clue to understand the results: the availability of bioelectricity coupled with CCS can significantly reduce the emission reduction burden. When CCS is unavailable, bioelectricity prevails, with nuclear and intermittent renewables complementing production. In scenario (3), production recovers to the level of scenarios with CCS (100 EJ in 2050). However, scenario (4) presents original features: a markedly low production (60 EJ in 2050) and the residual presence of gas for a quarter of the production, as no other option is available for electricity production.  Biomass production (Appendix K) is split into two categories: woody biomass and liquid biofuels. Liquid biofuels are produced to their maximum level. This explains why production levels are equal in scenarios with the same biomass potential, regardless of CCS availability. Woody biomass production shows extreme variations between scenarios. In scenarios with CCS, biomass production reaches 30 EJ in 2100 in the optimistic biomass case and 15 EJ in the pessimistic case. Scenario (3), as seen in the electricity mix, relies heavily on bioelectricity, and reaches 230 EJ of biomass production vs. 70 EJ in scenario (4). This is a second clue to explain the shape of the results: the availability of CCS or high biomass resources allow for more decarbonization options, which mitigates costs. Removing mitigation options should translate into higher carbon prices (Fig. 2b). Carbon prices in scenarios (1), (2) and (3) stabilize at around the same level (800–1000 $/tCO2).10 Yet, scenario (3) reaches lower costs in the long term. Scenario (4) unambiguously shows higher carbon prices from the start, which stabilize at over 3000 $/tCO2 2080 onwards. This higher level results from removing two essential mitigation options.  As a consequence, losses correspond in part to the transmission of higher carbon prices to the economy. Electricity prices (Fig. 11a, Appendix J) are slightly lower than baseline in 2050, with the exception of scenario (4). Indeed, long term electricity prices soar in scenario (4) due to higher carbon prices and the presence of gas in the electricity mix. The energy share in production costs (Appendix J) paints a similar picture: after 2050, the energy share in production costs for the industry sector decreases to reach baseline levels or lower in all scenarios except scenario (4). In addition, after 2060 the energy share in production costs in scenario (2) stabilizes at higher levels than scenarios (1) and (3), which explains why low biomass potential with CCS (2) does not seem to perform as well as high biomass potential without CCS (3) in the long term.  The prices of agricultural goods (Fig. 11b) are higher than baseline: by 9 % in scenarios (1) and (3), 21 % in scenario (2) and 36 % in scenario (4). Lower biomass availability translates into higher tensions on agricultural markets. The CPI (Appendix L) follows the same pattern. The modest CPI increase (10 %) in both high biomass scenarios explains the similarity of consumption costs in these scenarios. The higher CPI increase (23 %) in scenario (2) is related to the higher energy share in production costs and leads to slightly higher losses. Finally, in scenario (4), the CPI soars by 42 % in 2100, leading to a large increase in policy costs. Therefore, the absence of either option (CCS or large biomass resources) greatly increases long term costs. In summary, in the long term (after 2050), and when CCS is available, electricity is dominated by fossil fuels. The low share of BECCS nonetheless significantly contributes to global decarbonization through negative emissions, leading to similar carbon prices regardless of biomass potential. After a transient increase, electricity prices return to baseline levels while agricultural prices rise. As a consequence, the energy share in production costs returns to baseline levels. Finally, the CPI returns to its baseline levels in the medium term (2050) and slowly increases afterwards. The CPI is higher with a low biomass potential, which explains the higher policy costs in that case. When CCS is unavailable, bioelectricity becomes a major component of electricity production. Therefore, limited biomass resources result in lower electricity production, which is constrained to meet the emissions target due to its continued reliance on natural gas. Carbon prices increase threefold, pushing up agricultural and electricity prices. High carbon prices lead to a high energy share in production costs, increasing the CPI and reducing overall consumption. In the absence of CCS, large biomass resources are therefore crucial to prevent high long term costs.",346.06311

CCS availability directly impacts the electricity mix and the carbon tax required to meet the carbon constraint, which impacts electricity prices. The higher prices of electricity, carbon and therefore energy entail a higher share of energy in production costs. The consumer price index (CPI, measuring the costs of goods for households) rises to much higher levels when CCS is unavailable, which adversely impacts consumption. This section examines each step in turn. The emissions constraint triggers the fast decarbonization of the electricity sector, leading to more than 85 % abatement by 2050, which contributes to more than 40 % of global abatements (cf. Appendix H). Until 2020, the mix is similar in all scenarios, leading to little difference in costs. Electricity production (Appendix I) from coal and gas without CCS is phased out by 2050 in scenarios with CCS. Indeed, coal production starts decreasing very soon after the introduction of the carbon tax. Gas serves as a temporary replacement, before phasing out by 2050. After 2020, coal and gas with CCS start penetrating the electricity mix and the shift to fossil fuels with CCS is complete by 2050. The transition is very different in the scenarios without CCS. Gas without CCS only starts phasing out in 2040 (vs. 2020 with CCS available). Therefore, in 2050, the power sector undergoes two radical fast-paced transformations. First, electricity production from solid biomass starts in 2040. Bioelectricity reaches very rapidly a significant share of the mix (around 15 %). While biomass resources do not influence the entry date of BECCS, CCS availability locks electricity production in fossil fuels and delays bioenergy penetration from 2040 (without CCS) to 2060 (with CCS). This contrasts with results from intertemporal optimization models under perfect foresight, e.g. Magné et al. (2010), where an earlier date of entry of BECCS is required in the low resource case to achieve sufficient abatement. Our result is explained by the fact that Imaclim-R is not intertemporally optimizing and runs under imperfect foresight (Section 2.2.2). Second, electricity demand is greatly reduced compared to the scenarios with CCS (around 38 EJ vs. 60 EJ). In the medium term (until 2050, Fig. 2a), the constraint is reached more easily when CCS and large biomass resources are available, which translates into lower carbon prices. As described in Section 2.2.1, carbon prices in Imaclim-R are instantaneous path-dependent marginal abatement costs, and are determined by technical inertia and imperfect foresight. In the studied scenarios, the unavailability of CCS is the main driver of the increase in carbon prices, as CCS is technically available and cost-competitive at this temporal horizon. Removing the CCS option increases carbon prices by 10 % in 2020, 23 % in 2030, 46 % in 2040 and 57 % in 2050. The increase in carbon prices due to a lower biomass potential is smaller (as biofuels penetration is constrained and woody biomass is not competitive until 2040 in the optimistic scenario): reducing biomass potential raises carbon prices in 2040 by 8% at most. Higher carbon prices will lead to higher prices for households and productive sectors. Carbon prices and technology options impact electricity prices (cf. Appendix J). Every scenario shows a short-term increase of electricity prices (Fig. 11a), following fossil fuel price increases. Carbon prices remain high for 30 years, corresponding to the time required for the renewal of electricity capacities. Without CCS, electricity production relies slightly longer on gas, hence the continued increase in electricity prices, especially given the high level of carbon price. After 2050, electricity supply has adapted to heavy carbon constraints and prices return to baseline levels. This transitory increase in price explains the lower electricity production in the scenario without CCS (in 2050, prices are still more than double those with CCS). Higher carbon prices increase the weight of energy in production costs (Appendix J). In 2030, the energy cost share in energy-intensive industries rises from 10 % in baseline to 13 % with CCS and 14 % without CCS. After 2030, this share starts a slow decrease towards baseline levels in scenarios with CCS. However, energy costs keep inflating in the scenario without CCS and low biomass resources, reaching 16 % in 2050. The results are similar for other sectors. Biomass supply curves command higher biomass costs for higher biomass use. This leads to higher agricultural prices in scenarios without CCS (Fig. 11b), since electricity uses more biomass when CCS is unavailable (cf. Appendix K). Also, we assume that a given biomass potential is available at relatively higher costs in the pessimistic case. Higher energy and carbon prices raise the prices of goods, increasing CPI (Appendix L), which translates the prices increase of consumed goods. CPI increases in all scenarios after 2015. For scenarios with CCS, CPI is 4 % higher than baseline between 2020 and 2040 and returns to baseline levels in 2050. In scenarios without CCS, CPI follows a similar path to the case with CCS until 2025, but increases more significantly afterwards reaching +15 % in 2050. This increase in CPI directly impacts consumption and policy costs. Until 2050, the major determinant of costs is therefore CCS availability. CCS availability impacts the electricity mix, carbon prices and in turn electricity prices. The increase in electricity, carbon and overall energy prices leads to a high share of energy expenditures in production costs. All these effects add up to increase the costs of goods for households, implying lower consumption in 2050 when CCS is unavailable.",346.076446

We describe here two mains results: (i) CCS plays a major role in policy costs in the medium term (until 2050) and (ii) the availability of one of both technological options (CCS or high biomass potential) limits long term costs, which soar when neither option is available. Appendix F shows similar results for the average growth rate of GDP. Here, only technological alternatives are tested.  Consumption levels differ between a scenario with climatic policies and its corresponding baseline scenario. Climate policy costs are reported as the difference in the average growth rate of consumption compared to baseline. Using this cost metric, Fig. 1 shows an interesting temporal profile. In the short term (until 2020), the average growth rate of consumption shows a loss of 0.24 %, with almost no differences between all four scenarios. Costs increase rapidly until 2040, and the gap between scenarios with and without CCS considerably increase between 2040 and 2050. The peak in costs reaches 0.45 % loss in the average growth rate of consumption for the scenarios with CCS, compared to 0.75 % in the scenarios without CCS. Therefore, the availability of CCS appears to be the major driver of costs in the medium term in these scenarios. This story changes after 2050. Starting with the worst case scenario (4), losses stay close to 0.8 % until 2100. A high biomass potential improves the situation: while until 2050 costs were similar in both cases without CCS, after 2050, the case without CCS but with a high biomass potential (3) shows a recovery between 2050 and 2070 to reach costs similar to scenarios (1) and (2). The best case scenario (1) performs best. Until 2065, the scenario with CCS and with a low biomass potential (2) performs better than the scenario without CCS and high biomass potential. However, these scenarios are reversed after 2070. Moreover, when both scenarios with high biomass potential reach the same level of costs, the scenario with CCS but with low biomass sees an increase in costs. The conclusion for the long term is therefore that the unavailability of CCS combined with a low biomass potential would be very detrimental to the economy in a climate mitigation scenario. In addition, the availability of either option reduces costs to a level similar to the optimistic case (1). The following sections are dedicated to understanding the results described above: (i) CCS is a major driver of policy costs in the medium term (until 2050) and (ii) the availability of either option (CCS or large biomass resources) prevents high long term costs occurring when both options are unavailable.",346.07172

This set-up is used to estimate the costs of reaching a RCP 3.7 target with a carbon price as the sole instrument over the 2010–2100 period.

Biofuels and synthetic fuels produced from the liquefaction of coal are the main alternatives to refined oil. Biofuels penetration in liquid fuel markets depends on their availability and competitiveness with oil-based fuels. The constraint on the availability of agricultural land is thus captured by a threshold value on production.

It is very capital-intensive, which raises short-term and long-term macroeconomic issues (e.g. uncertainties on CCS, shifts to renewables), especially when ambitious climate policies could increase capital costs. The specificities of the electricity sector call for specific model features. Electricity cannot be easily stored and a constant balance between power available on the grid and demanded by final uses must be achieved at all times. Production must therefore adapt to major daily and seasonal fluctuations of demand. Load curves, technology specificities, capital intensity, capacity vintages and imperfect foresight should thus be modeled, as they determine investment decisions. The electricity supply module in Imaclim-R tracks production capacities over time, thus incorporating the inertia and path-dependency of the system. Investment decisions are made to meet future demand while minimizing long-term marginal production costs. To achieve this optimal mix, expectations are formed ten years forward for demand, fuel costs, and carbon prices. The profitability of production technologies depends on annual operating time, which derives from the short-term marginal cost minimization. The model covers the heterogeneity of fixed and variable costs for each technology and operational constraints. Indeed, both long term investment choices and choices concerning putting existing capacities into operation depend on the load curve. The minimization of the discrepancy between installed capacities and the expected optimal mix determines the required investments to reach this optimal mix over ten years. This process of optimal planning with imperfect foresight occurs every year and expectations adapt to changes in prices and demand. The choice of power technologies cannot simply be made using an aggregated merit-order: Imaclim-R represents investment choices based upon capacity vintages, imperfect foresight and load curves. Investment decisions are made for 26 technologies (15 conventional technologies including coal, gas and oil-fired, nuclear and hydro and 11 renewable technologies including biomass-fired thermal plants, with or without CCS, described in Appendix C). The share of each technology in the optimal mix results from a competition among available technologies depending on their mean production costs for yearly production durations following a logit function. That is, competition is differentiated to account for the fact that a capacity unit is expected to meet peak or base load demand. Other constraints are taken into account (e.g. social acceptability, investment risk, size of production units, market structure) via “intangible” costs, which translate in economic terms the constraints faced when making investment decisions, however not inducing any money transfer further along during production.  Our study focuses on the role of biomass to decarbonize the economy. Following the modeling specifications of Image described by Hoogwijk et al. (2009), land resources available for biomass production dedicated to power generation are restricted to abandoned agricultural land and rest land. The most conservative assumption of the four SRES scenarios (scenario A2 from Nakicenovic et al. (2000)) was retained for the maximum global biomass production (302 EJ/year) in 2050 (cf. Appendix D.1). Biomass-fuelled power plants are characterized by a cost structure and technical performances similar to coal-fuelled plants. The resource price is endogenous and depends on the level of biomass use. As a result, in all EMF27 scenarios, biomass is on average more than seven times more expensive than coal and four times more expensive than gas. Only very high carbon prices can make biomass competitive with fossil fuels. Biomass use greatly modifies the input-output structure of the economy, as electricity generation relies on agricultural products (including forests) instead of mineral resources, thus shifting production from imported fossil fuels to domestic agricultural goods. The outstanding issue of who shall benefit from the carbon tax combined with negative emissions, which corresponds to a direct subsidy, is debatable. The alternative lies between farmers and electricity producers: farmers capture atmospheric CO2 as biomass and electricity producers store it using CCS technologies. While electricity producers would probably not implement this technology unless the additional cost compared to conventional fuels is paid, farmers would not choose to grow bioenergy crops without strong incentives. Our modeling choice here is neutral, as farmers are paid by electricity producers at the level of their production costs (including a fixed profit) while electricity producers receive the subsidy on the amount of produced BECCS. However, they have to pay an equivalent amount, distributed on the final electricity production, and passed through to consumers, which makes this subsidy neutral for governments. This question should be",345.864483

Top-down models usually rely on aggregate production functions (Solow 1956). Conventional production functions describe available techniques and the technical constraints ruling the economy (Berndt and Wood 1975; Jorgenson and Fraumeni 1981). However, this aggregate representation of a continuous space of technologies is only theoretically justified near the equilibrium, and the use of constant elasticities of substitution may lead to incorrectly exceed feasible technical limits in the case of large departures from the reference equilibrium (McFarland et al. 2004; Hourcade and Ghersi 2006). Moreover, as reported in Waisman et al. (2012b), short-term econometric analyses have shown that modeling exercises can better reproduce the observed magnitude of the economic effect of energy price variations if they include (i) mark-up pricing to capture market imperfections (Rotemberg and Woodford 1996); (ii) putty-clay descriptions of technologies translating the inertia of capital stock renewal (Atkeson and Kehoe 1999); (iii) partial utilization rate of installed production capacities due to the limited substitution between capital and energy (Finn 2000); and (iv) imperfect expectations (Fisher et al. 2007; Downing et al. 2005). Bottom-up approaches represent sectoral mechanisms and behavioral patterns. Inertia and imperfect foresight may cause excess or shortage of supply, creating market disequilibria in the long-run (Sterman 2000; Rostow 1993). This, along with the trend towards power sector liberalization, calls for abandoning perfect foresight and using adaptive simulation models, as illustrated in Olsina et al. (2006). Market disequilibria create business cycles in the electricity sector (Bunn and Larsen 1992; Ford 1999) which were econometrically estimated by Arango and Larsen (2011). Also, electricity must be considered as a derived demand, that is to say electricity does not provide utility in itself, but allows for the use of other goods or services which directly provide utility (Taylor 1975). The representation of the electricity sector requires the explicit and detailed description of technologies (Bhattacharyya 1996). This high level of details commands the description of load demand curves (especially peak and non-peak) and short and long term demand, using for instance short-term marginal cost pricing as well as differentiated prices for different users (Taylor 1975). Moreover, the representation of inertia in the sector is indispensable, whether it be in end-use sectors (Silk and Joutz 1997) or in capital stock, leading to partial short run utilization rates (Taylor 1975). Imaclim-R aims at bridging the gap between top-down and bottom-up approaches, as identified in Hourcade et al. (2006), and incorporates bottom-up modules into a CGE framework.",346.069716

Bioenergy is usually considered a source of sustainable, clean energy for two crucial uses: transport and electricity. The enthusiasm surrounding bioenergy relates to possible negative CO2 emissions when combined with carbon capture and storage technologies (CCS). Indeed, low climate stabilization objectives may require net negative emissions towards the end of the century (Fisher et al. 2007). Negative CO2 emissions can be achieved through direct or indirect CO2 removal methods, for instance by enhancing land carbon sinks through land use management, natural weathering processes or the oceanic uptake of CO2, by the direct engineered capture of CO2 from ambient air or by using biomass for carbon sequestration (The Royal Society 2009). In the latter case, CO2 is removed from the atmosphere through photosynthesis as vegetation grows. This carbon can be sequestered in by cutting and burying the grown biomass (Metzger and Benford 2001) or by combining bioenergy and CCS (BECCS). While they remain uncertain and controversial, these technologies are often expected to play a significant role in long-term mitigation. Many studies show that negative emissions produced through BECCS could significantly reduce mitigation costs (Azar et al. 2006; Wise et al. 2009; Edenhofer et al. 2010; Luckow et al. 2010; van Vuuren et al. 2010).1 However, uncertainties remain on the economic and environmental impacts of the large scale production of biomass for energy purposes, in particular on land competition, agricultural prices and CO2 emissions from land-use change (Sands and Leimbach 2003; Fisher et al. 2007). The large-scale deployment of CCS has yet to be proven technically and economically feasible. For instance, large uncertainties remain on the size of geological storage reservoirs and their possible leakage (Metz et al. 2005). The potential unsustainability of these technologies leads to great uncertainty on the bioenergy and CCS potentials. The aim of our study is to reveal the impact of the availability of biomass resources and CCS on the cost of climate mitigation. The emissions constraint of the RCP 2.6 (Representative Concentration Pathway at 2.6 W/m2) scenario requires net negative emissions after 2070, which most models cannot achieve without BECCS. To examine scenarios without CCS, our study focuses on RCP 3.7 climate scenarios, for which global net negative emissions are not strictly required. Typical values for the sustainable potential of bioenergy production are around 200–400 EJ per year (van Vuuren et al. 2010).2 Depending on crucial assumptions on agricultural yields, this amount of biomass could require up to several Gha of additional land. With approximately 13 Gha of emerged land available, of which about a third are forests (5 Gha) and another third is agricultural land (4 Gha, of which 1.5 Gha are arable land and permanent crops), the additional stress on land use may in fact prove unsustainable in terms of biodiversity loss, local environmental impacts (air, water and soil quality), local land rights, rising food prices and greenhouse gas emissions from direct and indirect land-use change (Gallagher et al. 2008). This paper examines the role of bioenergy for low carbon stabilization targets and revisits the underlying, sometimes controversial, assumptions that models embody in terms of biomass availability. To that end, we examine mitigation scenarios, contrasted in their assumptions on biomass and CCS availability. To assess the implications of these assumptions from energy and economic perspectives, our model must integrate specific information on the electricity and liquid fuels sectors within a consistent economic framework. Such a setting is needed to reveal the impacts and interactions of BECCS with upstream and downstream economic activities. Therefore, this study uses a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model, coupled with bottom-up modules, including electricity supply representing available technologies and fuels and sectoral specificities, such as capacity vintages and investment crowding-out. In addition, biomass production and use result from the interaction of energy demand from all sectors, from the competition between liquid fuels and from the competition with agricultural goods. The sectoral bottom-up modules thus interact with the CGE framework to assess the macroeconomic effects of climate and energy policies. The paper is organised as follows. Section 2 discusses the gap in the literature in terms of integrated assessment of electricity production, land-use and the economy. It reveals the required model features prescribing specific model forms. Section 3 presents scenario results that challenge the idea that large biomass resources are needed to achieve ambitious mitigation targets. The scenarios examine the complementarity of bioenergy and CCS. The results show the influence of bioenergy and CCS on the (i) electricity mix, (ii) carbon prices, (iii) electricity prices, (iv) share of energy in production costs and (v) prices of goods for consumers. The aim is to elicit the determinants of macroeconomic costs and explain the time profile of mitigation costs. Section 4 discusses the impact of bioenergy use on land competition and the role of the timing of the efforts to limit the need for biomass resources. Section 5 concludes on the role of bioenergy deployment as a robust mitigation strategy.",345.84366

While carbon tax revenues inevitably go through an increase and decline pattern under a fixed cumulative emissions budget, net tax revenues are substantially lower with BECCS available because BECCS activities need to be subsidized. When total net emissions reach zero, subsidies and revenues match exactly. Furthermore, net negative emissions for the economy as a whole indicates that the climate change mitigation program is a net cost to the governments, and other revenue sources (e.g., from non-climate sources) are needed to pay for the negative emissions. While these extreme effects only occur after the middle of the century in scenarios likely to limit climate change to 2 °C, tax revenues as a fraction of GDP peak much sooner—in the 2030 timeframe. We observed little effect of BECCS on the global timing of peak tax revenues, which is primarily determined by the emissions path, but we noted significant regional effects, driven by land availability and use. In addition to changing the flow ofcarbon tax revenue in an economy, CCS also affects net energy trade. Limiting climate change to 2 °C reduces fossil fuel use. However, CCS tends to temper the decline in fossil fuel trade both by reducing CO2 emissions when coupled to fossil fuels and offsetting them when coupled to bioenergy (the net negative emissions from BECCS compensate positive emissions from fossil fuels). BECCS effectively enhances the emissions reduction capacity of bioenergy, by capturing and storing the carbon that is typically emitted when biomass is converted in final energy carriers (e.g., electricity or liquid fuels). In other words each joule of bioenergy transformed to a final energy carrier with CCS is up to twice as effective in emissions mitigation as one without CCS. This results in lower carbon prices than a scenario without CCS; the lower carbon prices result in less bioenergy produced and traded than when CCS is unavailable . Without CCS energy trade is almost entirely bioenergy trade by 2100: fossil fuel use and therefore trade are effectively extinguished. With CCS, fossil fuels continue to be used over the 21st century, guaranteeing a steady financial flow and energy independence to exporting regions. Over the 21st century the value of net exports ofbioenergy can be significant relative to GDP, with a larger impact in the scenario without CCS, because the bioenergy price is higher and more bioenergy is used. Moreover, the introduction of a carbon price and the large-scale use of bioenergy trigger a response in the land-use and agricultural system that increases revenues from the use ofland. In particular, as the carbon price rises, the value ofbioenergy rises in lock step since it is a renewable non-emitting energy option. As bioenergy becomes more valuable, the competition for the land puts pressure on the price of all agricultural commodities, including food. The increase in food prices is strongly correlated with carbon prices. Thus, the availability of BECCS tempers the upward pressure on price of agricultural products by reducing carbon prices. When carbon prices are equivalent, the presence ofBECCS, however, increases food prices. Both bioenergy and CCS face challenges in their deployment. Large-scale use of bioenergy, for example, might lead to significant indirect land-use change emissions, and/or interactions with food prices and availability. While we have illustrated the effects of including BECCS and CCS in the portfolio of mitigation options (e.g., lower carbon prices, lower food prices, etc), CCS technologies have not yet been deployed at large scale. Such deployment may require the establishment of institutions and policies to support and regulate their use. Moreover, additional technological challenges may arise with large scale CCS use (e.g., related to capture, transport, and storage of CO2). However, the technological challenges do not appear to be fundamentally changed when CCS is combined with bioenergy compared to other applications. Technological and institutional challenges related to large-scale bio-energy and CCS deployment need to be addressed before scenarios such as the ones presented in this paper could be realized. In this paper we focused on some of the economic implications of the inclusion of BECCS in a climate change mitigation policy. We have explored the economic impact ofscenarios consistent with meeting a2 °C goal in three domains: the macroeconomic scale of potential government tax revenues or expenditures, the impact on energy trade, and the economic impact on food prices. It is important to note that the inclusion ofan emissions limitation alone has a major effect on the global economy in these three domains, regardless of assumptions about BECCS. We find that the presence or absence of BECCS from the portfolio of available technologies produces noticeable differences in net government tax revenue, patterns of energy trade, and food prices. In particular, the exclusion of BECCS results in increased tax revenues, reduced fossil fuel trade, and increased food prices. The carbon price is a major mechanism through which the effects ofBECCS availability are realized.",433.97679

In the 2 Degree scenario primary energy use, shown in figure 4, is considerably reduced compared to the Baseline, as the carbon price leads to increased energy efficiency and reduced demand for final services. Additionally, CCS significantly contributes to the portfolio of technologies deployed: ∼17 Gt CO2 yr−1 are stored using CCS technologies in 2050, primarily for electricity and liquid fuels production, with BECCS accounting for 50% of it. About 31 GtCO2 yr−1 are stored using CCS in 2100, with BECCS responsible for 55%. If CCS is not available the energy reduction is more pronounced (a consequence ofhigher carbon prices), and renewables, nuclear and biomass take on a larger share of primary energy use, with biomass becoming the dominant energy source by 2100. Figure 5 reports the global financial flows associated with fossil fuels, biomass, and agricultural products trade in 2100 for the three scenarios considered in this paper, compared to 2010 historical values. Currently, fossil fuels account for the vast majority of energy trade, accounting for a significant portion of GDP in some major exporting regions such as Middle East and Russia (see figure 11 in the supplemental material). These flows are projected to increase in scale, if no climate change mitigation policy is implemented (second pane in figure 5) as result of increased use of fossil fuels. Also, biomass production in GCAM is projected to increase 8 fold by 2100, absent any climate policy. The imposition of a mitigation policy increases biomass use and reduces fossil fuel use compared to the Baseline scenario; however, the extent ofthat reduction depends on the availability of CCS. If CCS technologies are available fossil fuel consumption, prices, and trade are reduced compared to the Baseline scenario (see figure 9 in the supplemental material), but not eliminated. IfCCS technologies are not available, however, fossil fuels are virtually no longer used by 2100. Thus, while revenues from fossil fuel production would remain significant for exporting regions if CCS technologies are available (third pane in figure 5), they would virtually disappear if CCS technologies were not available (fourth pane in figure 5). For example, as shown in figure 11 in the supplemental material, while international trade of fossil fuel—which accounts for about 35% ofthe Middle East GDP in 2010—continues to grow in the 2 Degree scenario in absolute terms, its share of GDP decreases. If CCS technologies are not available, the import of biomass in the Middle East overcomes the financial revenues derived from the export of fossil fuels. Revenues from biomass trade are projected to become a significant share of GDP in regions such as the east part ofthe European Union (∼13%), Australia and New Zealand (∼8%), Canada (∼6%), and South Africa (∼15%) as shown in figure 11 in the supplemental material. If CCS technologies are not available this effect is amplified and extended to other regions (∼19% for the east part ofthe European Union, ∼16% for Australia, ∼10% for Canada, ∼17% for South Africa, and ∼10% for Russia). The export and import of bioenergy is sensitive to assumptions about crop and bioenergy yields and production costs, as well as the availability of CCS. Whether a region specializes in the production ofbioenergy or other agricultural and forest products depends on the relative profitability of the various options available to producers. In figure 5, for example, we find that the EU (in particular Eastern European countries such as Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and others) is a major bioenergy net exporter while Latin America is a net importer . While one might think that Latin America would be an excellent place to grow bioenergy crops, it is also an excellent place to grow other crops as well. Since land allocation is determined by comparative advantage across crops within a region, more land is devoted to crops with higher relative profit rates. In particular in these scenarios agricultural production, and thus export, of several crops increases significantly in climate change mitigation scenarios in Latin America. This partially compensates for bioenergy displacing other agricultural products in other regions, such as EU. Moreover, a large portion of agricultural products from Latin American is used for the production of first generation biofuels (e.g. sugar-cane ethanol in these scenarios). Figure 10, in the supplemental material, shows the land allocation across regions for the different scenarios. These changes in trade of primary energy commodities have a profound effect on the regional economy, especially for fossil fuel exporting regions, as well as for national energy independence. Figure 6 shows the share ofenergy traded compared to total domestic energy consumption (negative numbers indicate import), an indicator of the reliance of regions on imported energy. Again, unavailability of CCS technologies affects current energy exporters (regions exporting fossil fuels) by reducing their net energy exports, and favors those regions that produce and export biomass, such us the eastern part of the European Union. The increased use of biomass due to the climate change mitigation policies leads to a greater competition for the use ofarable land, putting significant pressure on the price of various food products . Carbon prices influence both the energy and agricultural prices because these markets are closely coupled. The carbon price affects the marginal price for energy by introducing a wedge between the production and sale price offossil fuels. As the sale price offossil fuels rises, demand for the untaxed bioenergy increases resulting in higher production and higher bioenergy prices. The higher price ofbioenergy results in increases in the prices of other agricultural commodities, as the competition for land puts upward pressure on food prices until those options become equally profitable. As Calvin et al have demonstrated, upward pressure on food prices is removed only when the use of purpose-grown biomass cannot be deployed at scale [22]7. Similar results are reported by Klein et al [23], which suggest that the ability of bioenergy to provide negative emissions gives rise to a strong nexus between biomass prices and carbon prices, since the carbon value of biomass tends to exceed its pure energy value. Therefore, Klein et al [23] identify the revenues generated from negative emissions, rather than from energy production, as the primary driving factor behind investments into bioenergy. However, our results show that the nexus between carbon price and biomass price applies in scenarios without BECCS as well, as shown by biomass price reported in figure 7. With higher carbon prices there is an increasing incentive to replace fossil fuels with bioenergy. The dependence of bioenergy prices on carbon prices is stronger in scenarios with CCS (as reported by Klein et al [23] and shown in figure 12 in the supplemental material), due to the potential revenues from net negative emissions, but in scenarios without CCS, still higher carbon prices required to mitigate climate change lead to even higher biomass prices. Under both climate change mitigation scenarios there are significant opportunities for revenues for bioenergy producers. We observe that deployment of CCS, including BECCS, would soften the impact on agricultural price increases, as shown in figure 7. This result is due to the lower carbon prices found in the scenario with CCS. At equivalent carbon prices, the availability of BECCS results in higher food prices. Lotze-Campen et al [24] compare the impacts of increasing cellulosic biomass consumption to 100EJ by 2050 on food prices across different models, showing results consistent with the baseline scenario considered here (where global biomass consumption in 2050 incidentally is 100EJ). Havlík et al [25] use the GLOBIOM model to study the effect ofsecond generation biofuels (e.g., ethanol and methanol produced from cellulosic biomass) showing strong effects on crop prices, and thus potentially on food security, when cellulosic biomass is grown on agricultural land. However, second generation biofuels sourced from forests are shown to have negligible effect on crop prices [25]. In our scenarios biomass displaces mainly pasture, forest and other arable land currently allocated to crop production.",434.696154

In particular, the carbon price needed to reach the climate objective, shown in figure 2, increases by almost three-fold in 2100 ifCCS technologies are not available. In the 2 Degree scenario, net global CO2 emissions, reported in figure 2, become negative in 2085. At that point, expenditures related to credits for CO2 sequestration become greater than revenues associated with the carbon tax. This has several implications. First, specific mechanisms to compensate biomass producers are required (or in an equivalent system—compensating BECCS deployment). Second, some sort of revenue stream is needed to cover the costs ofthe mitigation policy (e.g., reallocating revenue from the mitigation policy in previous years which involves recycling over decades and across regions if money collected when CO2 emissions are positive were to be used to pay for carbon removal credits). Finally, international cooperation is required since taxpayers will effectively subsidize biomass producers, who might be located in different regions. If carbon taxes were used to deploy BECCS, global net tax revenues from a climate policy, reported in figure 3, would peak around 2030 at ∼3% ofGDP, vanish all together around 2080, and become a burden to governments potentially amounting to a net subsidy of 0.2% of GDP by 2100. Reaching the same climate change mitigation objective without negative emissions (2 Degree No CCS scenario) avoids these issues but increases the burden of the mitigation policy on the global economic activity. That is, the cost of mitigation is higher in a scenario without CCS compared to the scenario in which CCS is available. The revenue from a carbon tax shows significant variation across regions. For example, the availability of CCS increases revenues in US and China, but decreases revenues in the EU, one of the largest biomass exporters in these scenarios. The results ofthe scenarios explored here illustrate how the availability of CCS influences the carbon price, and the energy-related financial flows, especially for regions exporting fossil fuels. This confirms the findings of McCollum et al [21], which suggest that carbon pricing reallocates financial flows between importing and exporting regions.",434.693324

In particular, we explore the implication of relying on negative emissions related to bioenergy with CCS by comparing a climate policy scenario where BECCS is available to one where CCS is not available. GCAM’s use of BECCS technologies in climate change mitigation scenarios occurs predominantly in the electricity and liquid fuels production sectors. In the analysis performed for this study, the projected deployment of CCS technologies—and in particular BECCS—is consistent with the range of other projections reported in the EMF-27 study [14] by 13 IAMs, reported in figure 1. In particular, IA models project a significant share of primary energy with CCS technologies by the end of the century, especially in stringent climate scenarios, with high reliance on BECCS. The widespread deployment of BECCS in GCAM projections is based on the assumption that biomass can be used across different sectors, such as power plants and bio-refineries, and traded internationally similarly to fossil resources or grains [15]1. International biomass trade is growing rapidly. While almost no liquid biofuels or wood pellets were traded in 2000, the world net trade ofliquid biofuels amounted to over 100 PJ in 2009 [16], and trade ofsolid biomass, such as wood pellets, amounted to over 300 PJ in 2010 [17]. Larger quantities ofthese products have been traded in more recent years and are expected to be traded internationally in the future [16–18]. We consider three scenarios in this paper: a Baseline scenario where no climate change mitigation policy is implemented; a ‘2 Degree’ scenario that follows the RCP 2.6 CO2 emission pathway described in van Vuuren et al [19] and largely adopted by the IPCC and the integrated assessment community at large [20]2; and a ‘2 Degree No CCS’ scenario that maintains the same cumulative CO2 emissions of the RCP 2.6 scenario, but addresses the lack ofCCS (and thus negative emissions from BECCS) by introducing a non-nega-tivity constraint whereby global CO2 emissions can not be net negative .

Delays in emissions mitigation may mean that human society overshoots or temporarily exceeds its cumulative emissions budget and requires a large use of negative emissions options, defined as the net removal of CO2 from the atmosphere, to bring back cumulative emissions to the desired total. Moreover, increasing the ambition of society’s long-term goal (e.g. 1.5 °C target) moves the date after which negative emissions become essential still closer to the pre-sent [2]. This has been the subject of numerous papers and assessments (e.g. [3]). Gasser et al [4] find that greater than 1 Gt yr−1 of negative emissions are required to meet the 2 °C target. Scenarios projected by several integrated assessment models (IAMs) show biomass coupled to carbon capture and storage as a key negative-emission technology to achieve cumulative emissions consistent with the 2 °C goal in a cost-effective manner [1, 5]. For example, a comparison study including 15 models [6] concludes that bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) could provide temporal mitigation flexibility that reduces near-term mitigation pressure, but they recognize the large uncertainty associated with the viability of large-scale bioenergy deployment. Koelbl et al [7] use the results of the EMF-27 study to explore the long-term role of CCS, showing that models consistently rely on BECCS under stringent climate targets. However, Koelbl et al [7] could not explain the large variation in results across models based on individual model assumptions. Lemoine et al [8] find that the anticipated availability ofcarbon removal options can reduce the near-term abatement optimally undertaken to meet a stringent climate target. Azar et al [9] use three energy systems models to show that BECCS significantly enhances the possibility of meeting ambitious climate change mitigation targets. Luckow et al [10] find that at carbon prices above $150/tCO2 the vast majority of biomass in the energy system is used in combination with CCS, and that CCS availability reduces the cost of reaching a climate target by offsetting CO2 emissions from sectors that are more expensive to decarbonize, such as transportation. Kemper [11] reviews BECCS applications summarizing recent findings and report-ing that ‘the majority of current publications seem to agree on a [biomass production] potential of at least 100 EJ yr−1 but are mindful of likely limitations, such as competition for land with food production’. However, little is known empirically about the global potential of emerging and future negative-emis-sion technologies, the sustainability and cost of large-scale deployment needed to meet proposed climate stabilization targets, or the climate feedbacks of entering a new carbon-negative world. While negative emissions at the scale of a single facility would not be expected to carry significant macroeconomic consequences, negative emissions on a global scale has the potential to change the flow of macroeconomic resources substantially. Although BECCS could allow recovery from an emissions overshoot, the effective-ness ofBECCS has not been proven at large scales, and BECCS might never reach technological maturity [12]. Also, BECCS might be seen as a temptation to postpone climate policy action, hindering emissions reductions, since it allows for removing CO2 pre-viously emitted. In this paper, we use the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM) to explore the global economic implications of large-scale negative emissions related to bioenergy with CCS in scenarios limiting global temperature rise to 2 °C. We are not considering other net-negative technologies, such as direct air capture, enhanced weathering, ocean disposal, or afforestation (see Smith et al [13] for a review of different negative-emission technologies). Instead, we focus our attention on the magnitude of international financial flows and crop prices that accompany large-scale deployment ofBECCS while limiting climate change to 2 °C. We find that there are major economic implications of deploying BECCS at scales needed to keep cumulative emissions at levels consistent with the 2 °C goal. Global financial flows associated with changed energy and agricultural trade patterns can lead to changes in net trade flows that are a substantial fraction of GDP. Changes in financial flows on this scale will require strong domestic and international institutions for their facilitation. However, there is presently no institutional structure in place that could facilitate the large-scale deployment of BECCS nor manage the large financial flows that would accompany it. Still, no additional technology is needed for BECCS deployment as compared to scenarios using biomass and CCS. Thus, no technological barriers to BECCS deployment exist if CCS is available and large-scale production of biomass is possible. However, BECCS requires specific mechanisms to compensate producers for the CO2 removed from the atmosphere. The millions of tons of CO2 captured would need to be subsidized, or bioenergy producers compensated for the carbon their crops remove from the atmosphere, and the accounting systems must be consistent and deployed internationally.",434.01472

The analysis yielded important findings regarding differences and similarities across world regions in relation to the influence of GDP, population, energy and carbon intensities on regional emission patterns and their sensitivity to economic growth and fossil fuel availability assumptions with and without climate policy. Emission trends and their drivers in the baseline differ notably across the five regions under analysis. Economic convergence results in some convergence of regional per capita emissions, but the variation across regions by the end ofthe century still remains large due to higher GDP levels in developed regions, higher energy intensity improvements in developing regions, and a gradually reduced reliance on dirtier fossils in developing regions as opposed to an inter-fuel substitution of oil with coal in developed ones. Under climate policy, all regions implement drastic emission reductions. Energy systems appear more flexible in readjusting their structure than do economic systems in reducing their energy demand. The imposition of a globally uniform carbon price induces significant convergence in per capita emissions across regions, but different regional potentials for carbon and energy intensity improvements result in differences in mitigation efforts and long term per capita emissions. The carbon price encourages larger energy intensity improvements in developing and emerging economies, which are faced with higher energy intensities in the base year. Also, investments in more efficient energy carriers and supply systems early in the century are observed in regions with currently low per capita emissions, like Africa and India. In the long term, base year patterns are superseded by technological mitigation potentials. Therefore, long-term per capita emissions are higher than the world average in India and Europe, and vice versa for the USA and Africa, largely due to different renewable resource endowments. Regional emissions are sensitive to baseline variation in a no-climate policy world, with faster growth and higher fossil fuel availability inducing higher cumulated emissions over the 21st century. Regional emissions sensitivity is significant, and it proved more responsive and regionally diverse in the case of fossil fuels variation as opposed to economic growth variations. Under economic growth variations, differences in emissions are primarily driven by differences in economic growth rates and energy intensity improvements. The latter buffers emissions growth but is nevertheless superseded by economic growth unanimously in all regions. Under fossil fuel variation, changes in emissions are mainly induced by differences in carbon intensities and energy mixes transformations. These demonstrate a more region-specific behavior due to differences in regional reserves and associated relative fossil fuel prices inducing diverse inter-fuel substitution effects across regions. Generally, higher fossils availability and faster growth are associated with higher mitigation efforts. However, the core findings associated to climate policy and regional mitigation strategies remain unaffected by the wide range of scenario assumptions about future economic growth and fossil fuel price trajectories. The relative contribution of individual regions to global emissions and the convergence of emissions across regions are not profoundly altered by economic growth or fossil fuel availability assumptions. In all baseline scenarios China, the USA and India are the greatest emitters in terms of cumulated 21st century emissions, accounting for almost 50 % of the global total. Differences in terms of per capita emissions between developed and developing countries persist under either baseline assumption, but are contracted under climate policy. Long-term per capita emissions remain above world average in China, India and Europe, reflecting their relatively smaller renewable resource potentials. Finally, the core regional technological implications of climate change mitigation are not siginificantly affected by economic growth and fossil fuel availability assumptions. The current analysis can be expanded to explore additional dimensions influencing regional emission pathways and mitigation strategies. The analyzed climate policy scenarios assume immediate and fully co-operative action across different parts of the world. Current policy developments are not in line with such an assumption, and thus the exploration of alternative baseline scenarios under delayed and fragmented policy scenarios would be of interest. The analysis is limited to variations in the speed of economic growth and fossil fuel availability, while further baseline assumptions including differences in the convergence across regions or the relative fossil fuel availability across fossils and regions might highlight further aspects of uncertainty on economic growth and fossil fuel prices. Also, it would be interesting to explore the effect of economic growth and fossil fuel price uncertainty on regional mitigation costs. Finally, the impact of baseline assumptions on international transfers, for example for establishing an equitable distribution of mitigation costs across regions, merits further attention.",346.007755

The REMIND model features a detailed representation ofregional energy systems characterized by high substitutability, but a stylized and aggregate representation of regional economic systems and energy demand. As a result, changes in the composition of energy systems are more adequately encapsulated than changes in the sectoral composition of regional economies. That is particularly important when discussing regional energy intensity improvements, especially in developing regions (see Steckel et al. 2013). Structural economic changes, such as a shift from heavy to light industries and/or services, are important drivers of energy intensity improvements. While the effect of these changes on the structure and magnitude of energy demand is reflected in the calibration of the model, the underlying developments on the level of economic sectors are not explicitly represented by the aggregate macro-economy of the REMIND model. The differences in modelled future development pathways across regions are driven by regional differences in the configuration of current economies and energy systems, different economic growth prospects, differences in energy demand drivers, as well as different endowments in fossil and renewable energy resources. However, there are additional important factors that explain regional disparities observed in the real world. Unit costs of energy technologies can vary substantially across regions, but are assumed to be uniform here. Institutional factors, governance, culture and social preferences play an important role in shaping regional energy transformations and are very dissimilar, yet are not accounted for in this study. External shocks or trend changes that can affect regional development are not considered, while fossil energy supply and long-term future GDP growth are accounted for with full anticipation in the intertemporal optimization model REMIND.  All these factors may lead to larger regional differences in emissions drivers and mitigation responses than identified in this study.

Achieving the 450 ppm CO2-equiv. stabilization target requires the abatement of 76 % of global emissions of BAU DEF (SM Table 2). Emission reductions are associated with both carbon and energy intensity improvements, but the effect of carbon intensity developments dominates (SM Figure 8). Energy intensities are in the range of 0.65 to 0.85 of the equivalent baseline values in the period 2050–2100, while carbon intensities in the range of −0.10 to 0.30. Energy intensity improvements take place mainly in the first half of the century, while carbon intensity improvements occur throughout the century and are the major determinant of emission reductions in the second half of the century. Although the stringent emission reduction requirements induce a general convergence pattern in per capita emissions, differences in regional capacities to abate their emissions and achieve very low per capita emissions are observed (Fig. 3). By the end of the century, India, Europe, and China do not reach as low per capita emission levels as do the USA and Africa, due to their relatively smaller renewable resource and CCS storage potentials. Emissions abatement throughout the century also differs across regions. Africa achieves an almost 100 % reduction of its baseline emissions, China, India, and the USA an about 70 % reduction, and Europe an about 60 % reduction (SM Table 2). These regional differences are motivated by discrepancies in regional base year emissions and energy mixes, and regional potentials to achieve energy intensity and carbon intensity improvements, analysed in turn in the following two paragraphs. Regarding base year emissions and energy mixes, the carbon price stimulates regions with low emissions at the beginning of the century, like Africa and India, to maintain these low levels throughout the century. On the other hand, the USA, Europe, and also China start from much higher levels of per capita emissions, and need to gradually reduce those through progressively restructuring their energy systems and putting more effort in suppressing initially much higher final energy demands per capita. As a consequence, the first group of countries requires less demand and/or supply side transformations which enhances their mitigation potential. Particularly the example of Africa, with a very low carbon intensity from early in the century, emphasizes the importance of avoiding carbon lock-ins by early climate action in regions where significant energy capacities expansion could be expected. The potential to achieve energy and carbon intensity improvements varies across regions. Energy intensities are reduced less drastically in developed regions, and particularly Europe, in comparison to Africa, India and China. This causes important differences in regional final energy per capita levels which, despite greater convergence compared to the baseline, remain substantially lower in developing regions compared to the industrialized world, and thus maintain their emissions at lower levels. This is in line with other findings in the literature that report greater energy efficiency reductions under climate policy for developing regions (e.g., Van Sluisveld et al. 2013), but is also a model result that has been criticized as incompatible with sustainable development objectives (Steckel et al. 2013). Carbon intensities decrease radically in all regions, but important regional differences remain, motivated by differences in regional capacities to deploy renewable sources. Africa and the USA, achieve greater carbon intensity reductions with respect to their baseline levels compared to the other three regions, mainly due to their greater deployment of biomass with CCS (BECCS) (SM Figure 9). Findings on the higher BECCS deployment of these two regions are also reported by other studies (e.g., Calvin et al. this issue; Van Sluisveld et al. 2013). It is noteworthy that, under stringent climate policy, emissions trajectories show very little variation across economic growth and fossil fuel availability scenarios (Fig. 3). Regional results are very much in line with global results (see Kriegler et al. this issue) since the climate target suppresses region-specific reactions to economic growth and fossil fuel availability. In the case offossil fuel variations, both carbon and final energy intensities remain almost entirely unaffected, indicating that under stringent climate policy fossils are abandoned rendering uncertainty about fossil fuel prices less relevant. Little variation in carbon intensities is observed also under economic growth assumptions. On the other hand, final energy per capita and energy intensity levels still show some sensitivity to GDP assumptions. In all regions, despite these variations in total energy demand and the scale ofenergy systems, the underlying structure of energy systems is not significantly impacted, notwithstanding some larger deployment of renewable energy sources to cover additional demand in the 450 FS Gr scenario (SM Figure 9). Regarding the effect of scenario variations to mitigation requirements, not surprisingly, in most regions faster growth or higher fossils availability, are related to higher mitigation effort in order to achieve the climate stabilization target (SM Table 2).10 The variation with fossil assumptions is clearly larger than with economic growth assumptions since baseline emissions differ more in the former case.",345.984013

These somehow counter-intuitive observations are primarily driven by inter-fuel substitution and changes in the deployment of coal-to-liquid technologies. Specifically, the USA and Europe, and to a lesser extent China, employ significantly lower coal for liquids as opposed to oil in the BAU HI Fos scenario (SM Figure 7). On the other hand, India and Africa are characterized by a significant increase in the shares of coal for liquids in the BAU LO Fos scenario, which combined with a sharp increase in their share of liquids in total final energy demand gives rise to higher emission growth rates in the second half of the century. Finally, energy intensities play a significantly smaller role than carbon intensities when varying fossil fuel availability assumptions.

Related findings are analysed below, first for the economic growth scenarios, and subsequently for the fossil fuel availability scenarios. Firstly, for the three different economic growth scenarios, China followed by the USA and then India remain the greatest emitting regions out of the five investigated ones in terms of cumulative 2005–2100 emissions (SM Table 1). Also, per capita emissions remain higher in the more affluent regions (USA, Europe, China), since faster growth leads to only slightly higher regional convergence in per capita income in the assumed variation of economic growth, and per capita income was identified as a key driver of per capita emissions. Nonetheless, growth assumptions have some significant implications for regional emission patterns. It is observed that generally faster growth (BAU FS Gr) is associated with 15 % higher total global cumulated emissions across the century compared to slower growth (BAU SL Gr). The sensitivity ofindividual regions differs slightly to the global average figure (20 % increase for India, 17 % for China, 14 % for the USA and EUR, and 10 % for Africa). Differences in the regional sensitivity of emissions to economic growth assumptions are, in the first halfofthe century, explained almost entirely by differences in the growth rates ofGDP per capita and energy intensity (Fig. 2). That is, faster growth leads to higher emissions due to the residual effect between higher GDP per capita and lower energy intensities (vice versa for faster growth), while carbon intensities remain almost unchanged. Differences in GDP per capita are, as explained in section 2, exogenous due to scenario assumptions, while lower energy intensities are motivated by faster growth due to higher substitution of energy with capital and higher autonomous energy efficiency improvements resulting in lower energy input per unit of GDP (see also section 3.1.1). These patterns are valid also for the second halfofthe century, but during this period carbon intensities are also contributing to the differences in regional emission patterns and regional sensitivity. Generally, in the second halfofthe century carbon intensities are lower for BAU FS Gr due to higher deployment of biomass and non-biomass renewables in all regions (SM Figure 7). These carbon intensity reductions, however, are not associated with lower cumulative extraction offossil fuels or with lower cumulated century emissions. That is because faster growth leads to faster exhaustion of cheap fossil reserves that, although it enhances the competitiveness of renewable energy sources earlier in time, it does not result in net emissions reductions over the course of the century. Some regional differences worth mentioning are that in the liquids sector developed regions substitute coal with oil under BAU FS Gr, while China and India do the inverse (SM Figure 7). Also, as biomass is assumed not to be tradeable in this REMIND version, biomass shares are seen to augment more in regions with higher potentials, and particularly Africa. Emissions and associated energy systems transformations are more sensitive to fossil fuel availability scenario assumptions, as opposed to economic growth assumptions. Cumulative century emissions increase by 45 % between the low fossil fuel availability (BAU LO Fos) and the high fossil fuel availability scenario (BAU HI Fos), and regional sensitivity differs significantly (71 % for Africa, 53 % for India, 34 % for China, 33 % for the USA, and 15 % for Europe) (SM Table 1). Although, per capita emissions remain higher than the world average in USA, Europe and China, and below for the other two regions for most of the century, the fossil fuel availability variations induce more pronounced differences in regional emissions convergence. Unlike under the variation of economic growth assumptions, in the case of variation of fossil fuel availability the differences in emissions are mainly induced by differences in carbon intensities, which tend to be lower under the BAU LO Fos scenario and higher for the BAU HI Fos scenario (Fig. 2). That is mainly because higher fossils availability is associated with higher oil shares for liquids consumption, higher gas and coal shares for electricity production, and lower renewables shares for all regions (SM Figure 7). The inverse trends are observed for lower fossil fuel availability, with higher shares of renewables in electricity production substituting coal and gas, and higher contributions of coal and biofuels, as opposed to oil, to synfuel production.",347.09042

China, followed by the USA and India, are the major emitting regions out of the five investigated ones in terms of cumulative century emissions (SM Table 1). Transformations throughout the century result in an increasing contribution of today’s emerging and developing economies into global emissions, accompanied by a decreasing one ofdeveloped economies.  Despite these changes, only modest convergence is observed across developed and developing countries until the end of the century (Fig. 1). Specifically, emissions in the USA, but also Europe and China, start and remain above the world average throughout the century, while they remain below for Africa and India despite considerable increases in the first half of the century. Naturally, population is one ofthe factors that drive the differences between major emitting regions in total and per capita emissions. The influence of population is greater for Africa, India and China (Fig. 1). In Africa, population triples by the end of the century, and the associated increasing trend until 2080 is partly responsible for the steep increase in total emissions. In India and China, rising population until 2050 and 2030 respectively, drives emissions upwards, but after these years shrinking population reduces emissions. Per capita final energy demand is a key driver ofdifferences across regions. Similarly to per capita emissions, it is higher in developed regions and only partial convergence across regions takes place throughout the century, due to differences in regional economic growth rates and final energy intensity improvements (Fig. 1). Indeed, the tendency for these two factors to explain most of the variation of emissions in baseline scenarios is confirmed in many other studies (e.g., Blanford et al. 2012). Regarding the influence of economic growth, two phenomena are observed. First, higher GDP levels in the USA, Europe, and China (which catches up with European levels by 2080), are a major explanatory factor of their higher final energy demand per capita (Fig. 1). Second, high economic growth rates in China and India mainly for the first half of the century, and also Africa throughout the century, are increasing convergence in per capita final energy demand and emissions. The augmentation of per capita emissions due to economic growth is partly counterbalanced by energy intensity improvements (SM Figure 4). Emerging and developing regions are associated with higher energy intensity levels at the beginning of the century, but they exhibit more accentuated energy intensity improvements compared to the developed regions (Fig. 1). This reduces their energy demand growth rates, and as a result their emissions growth rates, and slows down the associated emissions convergence in the second half of the century. An important reason for these effects is the modernization of the energy systems of developing regions towards more efficient energy carriers, and namely their transition towards grids and away from solids (SM Figure 6). Further, higher capital accumulation in developing regions is leading to a more intensive substitution of energy with capital, resulting in higher energy intensity improvements in these regions.  A third reason is regional differences between autonomous (non-price driven) energy efficiency improvements. These assume a convergence in energy use per capita between regions with converging per capita income, as observed historically (Grübler 2004). As a consequence, these regions are associated with higher autonomous energy efficiency improvements than developed regions, and that is also portrayed in the resulting energy intensity levels. Thirdly, carbon intensities are an important and notably diverse driver across regions. Absolute carbon intensity levels are generally higher than the world average for China, India, and the USA (Fig. 1), since their energy systems are more heavily reliant on coal and oil (SM Figure 5). The temporal evolution of carbon intensities differs distinctively across developing, emerging, and developed economies. In less developed regions, namely Africa and to some extent India, carbon intensities increase sharply during the first few decades ofthe century but decline thereafter. Such carbon intensity developments for Africa are in line with findings of other models (see Calvin et al. this issue). This strong carbonization in the first half ofthe century is due to increasing fossil fuel use caused by a) a switch from traditional biomass to coal for solid fuels, b) increasing use of gas for grids, and also coal for electricity in India, and c) higher liquids demand supplied entirely by oil (SM Figure 6). In the second half of the century, reliance on dirtier fossils is reduced with solids being gradually replaced by grids, and increasing use of renewables for electricity and biofuels for liquids. Significant deployment of renewables is particularly evident in Africa for both electricity and liquids. For the developed regions carbon intensities initially decline but later in the century (around mid-century in the USA and 2080 in Europe) they rise again.  These regions shift from a significant reliance on oil and gas in the beginning of the century to considerably higher coal shares, primarily for the production ofsynthetic liquid fuels later in the century. These give rise to the carbon intensities and emissions rises mentioned above.  China bears similarities to both developing and developed regions regarding its coal use, with coal initially being used for solid fuels and towards the end of the century for liquids.",346.99685

REMIND is a multi-regional hybrid model which couples an economic growth model with a detailed energy system model and a simple climate model. The macro-economic core of REMIND is a Ramsey-type optimal growth model in which intertemporal global welfare is optimized subject to equilibrium constraints. REMIND considers 11 world regions (SM Figure 3) and explicitly represents trade in final goods and primary energy carriers. Macro-economic production uses capital, labor and energy as input factors. The macro-economic core is hard-linked to the energy system module. Economic activity results in demand for final energy such as transport energy, electricity, and non-electric energy for the stationary end-uses. Two important REMIND features that highlight the capacity of the model to assess the effect of economic growth variations and fossil fuel availability are respectively (i) the use of energy as a production factor, resulting in dynamic feedbacks of economic growth variations on energy demand, and (ii) the explicit representation of fossil fuel extraction and international markets. These two features are described in more detail in the following two paragraphs. The demand for final energy is determined via a nested constant elasticity of substitution macro-economic production function, where economic activity results in demand for final energy. There are two basic mechanisms for energy intensity improvements: (i) autonomous reductions in energy intensity,  determined by exogenous factors which augment technological change, and (ii) substitution between energy and capital according to the CES production function (Luderer et al. 2013b).4 The exogenously determined factors which augment technological improvements of energy are assumed to change at similar rates as labor augmenting technological change factors, but include also an additional adjustment factor determined separately for each region and energy type. These adjustment factors are calibrated such that (a) total per-capita final energy demand converges between regions, when expressed as final energy per capita over Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita (expressed in Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) terms), and (b) patterns of structural change in final energy demand in line with past trends are reproduced (e.g., increasing trend for grid-based energy carriers). Labor technological change factors are exogenous and, in particular for the RoSE project, are adjusted to match the different economic growth scenarios. The growth of labor productivity results in the growth of economic activity, which drives final energy demand via the production function. The energy system module considers endowments of exhaustible primary energy resources as well as renewable energy potentials. A substantial number (~50) of technologies are available for the conversion of primary energies to secondary energy carriers. In particular the fossil fuel supply section of the energy module has been modified in a way that it captures important features of the RoSE fossil fuel scenarios, such as heterogeneity and inertia in the extraction sector through the representation of endowments via different cost grades (Bauer et al. this issue). Fossil fuel endowments are regionally specified, and coal, oil and gas are traded internationally. Fossil fuel trade is subject to trading costs that imply regional price differentials. ",346.06007

Although the debate around the preferred mitigation strategies, the distribution of costs, and the quantification of climate damages is a vibrant one, the scientific community has clearly pointed out the need for deep emission reductions in order to avoid the most dangerous outcomes of climate change. In the policy arena, the global community has adopted the long-term target of limiting the average global temperature increase to a maximum of 2 °C compared to pre-industrial levels in the Copenhagen Accord (UNFCCC 2009) and this objective has been re-endorsed in the subsequent climate conferences in Cancun and Durban. Given the broad agreement of the scientific and policy communities on the need for significant emission reductions in order to meet the 2 °C target, numerous studies have assessed the technical and economic implications of policy action on a global scale (e.g., Edenhofer et al. 2010; Van Vuuren et al. 2007). Nonetheless, policy action is to a large extent driven by national- and region-specific decision making, which emphasizes the importance of the regional dimension in the climate debate and stipulates a profound understanding of future regional emission patterns and their drivers. Regional differences in resource endowments and structural differences in energy end-use clearly determine regional differences in technology use and respective mitigation potentials (Clarke et al. 2012; Luderer et al. 2012). Thus, a comprehensive analysis of regional responses to baseline and policy drivers is crucial for identifying the mechanisms that can lead to a global long-term climate stabilization agreement. Several studies discuss the implications of climate stabilization with a focus on individual regions, using national or global models. Some examples include the work of Chen et al. (this issue) and Zhang et al. (2014) on China and Calvin et al. (this issue) on Africa, or the analysis of Asian regions in the Asian Modeling Exercise (Blanford et al. 2012; Calvin et al. 2012; Clarke et al. 2012). A few studies compare regional patterns of mitigation between major world regions (Van Sluisveld et al. 2013; Tavoni et al. 2013; Luderer et al. 2012). However, these studies do not explore the impact of different assumptions about the future development of emission drivers in the baseline on the level and structure of regional mitigation efforts. Baseline scenario assumptions on uncertain parameters like economic trends, population growth, technological progress, and portfolio of considered technologies can significantly affect emission levels in the absence of climate policies, and as a consequence the absolute level of emissions reductions required to meet a particular climate target (Keppo and Rao 2007; Fisher et al. 2007; Den Elzen et al. 2010). This uncertainty is a major concern of many countries, in particular emerging economies, when considering the adoption of national emissions reductions targets. Despite the importance of this aspect, a comprehensive exploration of alternative baseline scenarios has attracted so far little attention in the literature. This paper makes a contribution in this direction. A key novelty of the paper is the broad and systematic assessment of the extent to which uncertain baseline patterns of economic growth and fossil fuel availability impact regional emissions, emission drivers, and regional mitigation potentials and strategies. To our knowledge, this analysis is the first structured exploration, at a regional level, of a multitude of baseline and stabilization scenarios on two uncertain and crucial factors for assessing the challenge of achieving long-term climate protection targets: economic growth determining energy demand and fossil fuel availability influencing fossil prices and the supply structure of energy systems. The objective of the paper is to assess which regional results are sensitive across a wide range of these uncertain baseline patterns versus results that remain robust against different levels of economic growth and fossil fuel availability.",346.992173

Important differences are identified in emission trajectories of developed, emerging and developing regions, in both the baseline and the climate policy scenarios, due to differences in economic growth rates, energy and carbon intensity developments, and mitigation potentials. In the baseline, energy intensity developments vary strongly with economic growth assumptions, while fossil fuel availability has a particularly strong effect on carbon intensity developments which result in more region-specific sensitivity than do economic growth variations. On the other hand, the core findings associated to climate policy and regional mitigation strategies remain unaffected by this uncertainty. In all baseline scenarios China, the USA and India are the greatest emitters in terms of cumulated 21st century emissions, comprising almost 50 % of the global total. Differences in terms of per capita emissions between developed and developing countries persist under either baseline assumption, but are contracted under climate policy. Long-term per capita emissions remain above world average in China, India and Europe, reflecting their relatively smaller renewable resource potentials.

These curves have been used in an overall framework comparing different CO2 emission mitigation options. We have shown that a potential of up to 2,700 MtC/yr by the end of the twenty-first century is possible, depending on assumptions made. The associated costs are low up to 2025, but are projected to substantially increase afterwards. Still, the costs remain low compared to the costs of other mitigation options in the energy system (including energy crops) and for non-CO2 emissions. Although direct comparison with other studies is not straightforward, the range of supply and costs presented falls well in the range of other (regional and global) carbon sequestration cost–supply studies. An exception is East Asia, where our land prices might be too high and where revenues from timber extraction are more important than in other regions. The largest source of uncertainty for the projected sequestration potential and associated costs is the assumed growth of carbon plantations compared to the natural vegetation, as expressed in the Additional Growth Factor (AGF). Especially if growth falls short, costs per ton of carbon will strongly increase. A different baseline scenario then B2 has a limited impact on costs, suggesting that costs do not strongly depend on the baseline scenario used. Next steps will deal with comparing the potential of energy crops and carbon plantations, including revenues from harvested wood and their impact on the wood and land market (i.e. leakage), the inclusion of regional implementation factors and of other cost components such as maintenance and monitoring. Regional consequences will also be evaluated in more detail, especially for East Asia. To improve the carbon cycle modelling (and thus the carbon sequestration computation), we are currently working on the inclusion of a Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (DGVM). Also, an AOGCM of intermediate complexity will be incorporated in IMAGE to allow for the simulation of climate–vegetation feedbacks, such as albedo and precipitation changes due to changing vegetation patterns (see Bouwman et al. 2006 for more details).",346.0143

Up to 2060, the computed sequestration potential for China (or actually East Asia) in our analysis is comparable to theirs (see Fig. 5), but only for considerably higher costs (Fig. 7). The negative costs in Sathaye et al. (2001) are caused by high timber prices in China, something that is not included in the study presented. Another interesting region is South Asia (including India). In our analysis this region has practically no potential. Sathaye et al.

The main reason for our much lower estimate is the fundamental requirement of not allowing interference with agriculture. Benítez-Ponce and Obersteiner (2006) conclude that ‘most least-cost afforestation projects are located in Africa, South America and Asia.’ Our analysis confirms this result for Africa and South America (see Fig. 8).

If, however, we were also to include harvested timberland, the global potential between 10 and 150 dollars would be 75 MtC in 2010 and about 1.2 GtC/yr in 2075 and 2100 (see Table 5). More than 2 GtC would be obtained only at costs above 235 $/tC. The potential for the USA in the same cost range would be 3 MtC/yr in 2010 and 150 MtC/yr in 2100. A potential of250−500 MtC/yr could be obtained in 2100 at cost levels around 300 $/tC. This would bring our results to the low end of the range in these other studies. The main reasons for this are that we: (1) largely excluded revenues from harvested wood, (2) only account for the additional carbon sequestration compared to the natural vegetation, and (3) do not convert existing agricultural land to carbon plantations, i.e. there is no interference with the food and feed production. Benítez-Ponce and Obersteiner (2006) present a global country-risk adjusted  cost-supply curve based on a grid cell analysis for the next 20 and 100 years. They consider croplands, grasslands, shrublands and savannas, excluding (potentially) highly productive land. They show that in the next 20 years, about 9 GtC can be sequestered below 400 $/tC. In the next 100 years, this will be about 65 GtC. If we include these land classes in our analysis and also apply a country-risk adjustment of minus 60%, our cumulative potential carbon sequestration in the first 20 years is almost 9 GtC below 400 $/tC and 108 GtC in the first 100 years (see Table 5). Thus the results are almost equal in the first 20 years, but differentiate in the longer term. The difference is caused mainly by the differences in method: i.e. an analysis based on land cover changing over time instead of using the land cover as it is now. Furthermore, we explicitly model the carbon cycle, while Benítez uses the carbon uptake from spatial databases.",346.925834

It is, however, not directly clear how they adjusted data for variations among studies, which complicates comparison with our results. When looking at the underlying studies in more detail it seems that: – The time-frame of most studies is between 50 and 140 years – Land costs form the most important cost factor and are always included – Initial treatment costs (or establishment costs) are almost always included – Revenues from timber have been included to a limited extent – Administration costs and maintenance costs have either not been included or only to a limited extent – Most studies refer to afforestation of former agricultural land and reforestation of harvested or burned timberland – Most ecosystem carbon components are included – Additionality of the carbon sequestration is not taken into account – Secondary benefits have not been taken into account Unfortunately, it remains unclear to what extent: – Their estimate applies to the full time-frame, or whether this level is reached at the end of the period – The baseline scenarios used differ from the baseline scenarios in the study presented",345.819394

Nilsson and Schopfhauser (1995) estimated, for example, that only 275 Mha carbon plantations will actually be available out of the global total of 1.5 billion ha (=18%), due to social, political, cultural and infrastructural barriers. Likewise, in a study on Clean Development Mechanisms (Waterloo et al. 2001), eight implementation criteria are distinguished, including additionality, verifiability, compliance and sustainability. If all eight criteria were to be applied, they estimated that only 8% of the potential area would actually be available. This number increase in time and with increasing permit prices. Benítez-Ponce and Obersteiner (2006) introduced ‘country risk considerations,’ stressing that investments in many developed countries are more preferred than in ‘risky’ countries from a political, financial and economic point of view. They showed that applying this country risk concept, carbon sequestration potential may be reduced by approximately 60%. Although such geographically differentiated implementation rates are interesting, it may be difficult to apply in our method because of its perspective up to 2100 for which political considerations are highly uncertain. Nevertheless, we will evaluate the use of regional implementation factors in the near-term future.

Geographically speaking, the largest contributors in the coming 20 years are South Africa and the Former SU. By the end of the century, the lead is taken over by East Asia (China) and South America.

If harvest takes place when average Net Ecosystem Production decreases the potential increases by 8 to 10%, but in practice the NEP criterion is almost impossible to verify. The potential would increase by 55 to 75% if carbon plantations were allowed on harvested timberland. It is, however, questionable whether this can be considered as a sustainable option. Up to 2025 the largest part of the (limited amount of) carbon sequestration potential can be supplied for costs of less than 100 $/tC. But the costs are projected to rise during this century. We project that in the second half of this century more than 50% of the potential can be supplied only at costs over 200 $/tC. Compared to the costs of other mitigation options in the energy system (including energy crops) and for non-CO2 emissions this is still a rather cheap option.

Choosing an appropriate discount rate is always a major source of discussion. Nilsson and Schopfhauser (1995), for example, suggest discount rates in the range of 0–10% for long-term forestry projects. But there is no rational consensus on how to set the rate. They even propose using an array of interest rates in global analysis in order to catch regional specifics.

The pattern of the potential sequestration rate is similar between the three harvest regimes, but the total sequestration amounts differ considerably. The highest potential will be achieved when harvesting at the moment NEP decreases. The lowest sequestration potential is reached if plantations are permanently grown. The differences (in terms of GtC/yr) between the harvest options occur mainly in the second half of the century. Permanent plantations have the highest sequestration rates at 25 to 50 years after an initial period of 0 to 10 years. After these 25 to 50 years the sequestration potential decreases, while it remains high or even increases when harvest takes place. Table 4 shows that harvesting when NEP decreases leads to an additional supply of 7.5% compared to harvesting when MAI decreases (see Fig. 4), while costs per tC decrease by 11%. Therefore, harvesting when NEP decreases, is most logical from the incentive of mitigating climate change but hard to implement in practice, because the NEP of a plantation is almost impossible to verify. Furthermore, it should be realized that regularly harvested plantations sequester more carbon than permanent plantations only ifthe harvested does not disturb the wood market (i.e. leakage) and ifthe displacement factor is not (much) smaller than 1.

The reason of a lower decrease in plantation area is that the additional agricultural land comes not only from reduced abandoning, but also from clearing new land in some regions. ‘Global Orchestration’ shows a substantial decrease in agricultural land demand of 450 Mha (−17%), while the potential plantation area increases by 125 Mha (+16%). This difference occurs because large areas never become agricultural land at all and are therefore never abandoned.

This in line with the findings by Richards and Stokes (2004) and Benítez-Ponce (2005). When reducing the AGF values by 20%, the cumulative net carbon sequestration up to 2100 decreases by 37%, whereas it increases by one-third when assuming a 20% higher additional growth. This large effect is caused mainly by a changed uptake of the plantations. The uptake changes are larger than the changes in AGF, because what counts is the additional uptake of a carbon plantation compared to what the underlying natural vegetation would do. For example, if the AGF is increased from 1.8 to 2.16 (= +20%) this implies a 45% increase in the uptake of a plantation compared to the natural land cover (2.16−1=1.16 instead of 1.8−1=0.8). The potential plantation area also slightly decreases under a lower AGF, because a plantation becomes less effective and might no longer be able to sequester more carbon than the natural vegetation.

The reason of doing this is the current scientific debate on the large-scale response of ecosystems to increasing atmospheric CO2 levels (e.g. Heath et al. 2005; Körner et al. 2005). The CO2 fertilization in agriculture has been left unchanged, because this has to our knowledge not been questioned in the literature. Reducing the fertilization factor, lowers the global Net Primary Production to 10–24%, resulting in 23–50% reduced carbon net uptake of natural ecosystems. This is equivalent to more than 6 GtC per year by the end of the century. The potential carbon plantation area increases by 2 to 6% because slightly less agricultural land is needed to cover the food and feed demand. This is because higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations stimulate agricultural production. The total potential carbon sequestration in carbon plantations (‘Total supply’ in Table 4) increases less than the potential area because the lower CO2 fertilization factor reduces the additional carbon sequestration of carbon plantations compared to the natural vegetation. Costs per tC (for the first Gt reduction potential) substantially change for the same reason. In fact, this factor has the least impact on costs compared to the other factors.

In a 550 ppmv stabilization scenario these prices are between 250 $/tC and 450 $/tC, while a stabilization level of 450 ppmv results in prices of 500 $/tC to 1000 $/tC. Given these prices, 50 to 100% of the useable carbon sequestration potential will be utilized. However, since large emission reductions are needed, the relative contribution of carbon plantations in an overall mitigation strategy will always be low. In Van Vuuren et al. (2007), starting from the same B2 baseline scenario as in this analysis, it is shown a 450, 550 and 650 ppmv stabilization level need a cumulative emission reduction in this century of 1200, 850, and 650 GtC, respectively. Respectively, only 37, 29, and 19 GtC of these amounts (or around 3%) can be achieved through the establishment of carbon plantations, given an implementation factor of 0.1 in 2005, increasing to 0.4 in 2030 and thereafter.

For 2010 and 2025 the largest part of the carbon sequestration potential can be supplied at costs of less than 100 $/tC. This is relatively cheap compared to other mitigation options. In the FAIR model, these are Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), fuel switch, use of energy crops, energy efficiency improvement, reduction of non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy, nuclear energy and a category of other measures (see Van Vuuren et al. 2007 for more details). In 2050, less than 30% of the carbon sequestration potential can be supplied below 100 $/tC and 75% below 200 $/tC. Even that is reasonably low compared to other options. Beyond 2050 the costs of carbon plantations increase considerably. In 2075 only 14% of the sequestration potential is achievable for less than 100 $ and 54% for less than 200 $/tC. In 2100 these percentages are 8 and 44, respectively. So prices will go up early in the second half of this century. With respect to the costs of sequestering carbon, large differences exist between world regions (Fig. 7). These differences are mainly driven by land costs and differences in growth rates. For example, in 2025 the full potential of the largest supplier, Southern Africa, can be obtained at the lowest costs (see Fig. 8a). This due to the low land costs in Southern Africa (see Fig. 7) and the highest potential average carbon plantation sequestration rates (see Fig. 5b). On the contrary, although European growth rates are higher than in the former Soviet Union and South America (see Fig. 5b and c), costs per hectare are much higher due to land being relatively expensive. A general trend is that higher availability of land coincides with lower land costs and higher carbon sequestration rates, and thus larger potentials against lower costs result. A remarkable exception is East Asia. In 2025 the sequestration potential is almost zero due to the lack of available land, resulting in high costs. In 2100, the carbon sequestration is still expensive, despite the large increase in land available. Costs start around 300 $/tC and less than 50% can be obtained below 500 $/ha. This is because land costs are already high in 2025 and increase relatively fast in the course of the century, even if more land becomes available. One could argue that land costs in East Asia should not keep going up so much, since decreasing land scarcity should result in lower land prices. In this case, the assumed relationship between GDP and land costs (see Eq. 1) should be reconsidered for that region. On the other hand, since East",345.86101

Figure 5 shows the world-level supply curves for the B2 scenario at five different moments in time. As explained in Fig. 2, the curves go from grids cells with a high sequestering potential at the beginning (i.e. a gentle slope) to low sequestration at the end (i.e. a steep slope). The average sequestration rates for the subsequent supply curves increase from 2.2 tC/ha in 2010 to 3.4 tC/ha in 2100. This is due to more productive areas becoming available later in the century. Note that the increase is not caused by climate change, since the carbon sequestration rates have been corrected for this. At the regional level (Fig. 5b), four regions make up the lion’s share of the supply in 2025: Southern Africa, the former Soviet Union, South America, and Europe (sum of OECD Europe and Eastern Europe). Southern Africa has the largest potential due to crop yields that increase faster than food and fodder demand, resulting in a decreasing need for agricultural land from 226 Mha in 2000 to 168 Mha in 2025. The large potential available in the former Soviet Union is mainly due to decreasing population numbers (−6%) and slightly increasing crop yields, again both resulting in less land needed for agriculture. The relative high potential of Europe is due to stabilizing population numbers while yields go up, especially in Eastern Europe (+23%). In South America, slowly decreasing population growth combined with a relatively fast increase in crop yields results in a decreasing need for agricultural land, starting in 2020. This trend continues in the remainder of the twenty-first century making South America the second largest supplier of carbon sequestration in 2100 (Fig. 5c). In our analysis, the largest supplier in 2100 is East Asia (mainly China). Population size peaks in 2030 at almost 1.6 billion and decreases to 1.3 billion in 2100, while average crop yields increase by 22% in the same period. This results in a 65% decrease in agricultural land. Over 220 Mha becomes available for carbon plantations, which potentially sequesters 1 GtC per year. In 2100 the former Soviet Union, Africa (excl. North Africa), USA, and Europe supply around 200 MtC each. Europe shows the highest sequestration potential per hectare, comparable to East Asian levels. Relatively fertile agricultural land is abandoned in Europe, potentially supporting fast-growing plantations of mainly poplar. The potential in South Asia (incl.

These scenarios (A1b, A2, B1, and B2) explore different pathways for greenhouse gas emissions in the absence of climate policy on the basis of two major uncertainties: the degree of globalization versus regionalization and the degree of orientation on economic objectives versus an orientation on social and environmental objectives. New insights have emerged for some parameters: for example, both population scenarios and economic growth scenarios in low-income regions have been lowered (Van Vuuren and O’Neill 2006). In general, the B2 scenario focuses on possible events under medium assumptions for the most important drivers (i.e. population, economy, technology development and lifestyle). In terms of its quantification, the B2 scenario used here follows roughly the reference scenario of the World Energy Outlook 2004 in the first 30 years. After 2030, economic growth converges to the IPCC B2 trajectory. The long-term UN medium population projection is used for population (UN 2004). The demand for energy crops is determined according to Hoogwijk (2004). Trends in the regional management factors for agriculture, which reflects the difference between potential attainable yields and the actual yield level, have been taken from the ‘Adapting Mosaic’ scenario of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (Carpenter and Pingali 2005). The assumptions for population, economic growth and management factors in the A1b and B1 scenarios have also been taken from the respective scenarios, ‘Global Orchestration’ and ‘Technogarden,’ in the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. All other assumptions are based on the earlier implementation of the SRES scenarios (Strengers et al. 2004; IMAGE team 2001). The differences in socio-economic conditions and environmental conditions (see Table 3) have considerable effects on the demands for and growth rate of food, fodder, and energy crops and wood, thus on the area needed for agriculture. These different trends result in different areas being potentially available for carbon plantations, both cumulative and over time (Fig. 3). These areas are used as input for the simulation of different carbon sequestration potentials.",346.925825

In our study, GTAP data (GTAP 2004) for land values of agricultural land in 2001 are used. Land costs in GTAP are defined as the sum of value added from crop production and land-based payments such as subsidies (see Table 1). The average value of abandoned agricultural land will probably be lower than the average value of existing agricultural land because of our assumption that grid cells with the lowest agricultural productivity are abandoned first. Therefore we might (slightly) overestimate the land costs in our analysis. We compared the annual GTAP land values (GTAP 2004) with capital values from the World Bank (Kunte et al. 1998) (see Table 1). These values are defined as the present discounted value of the difference between the world market value of three major agricultural crops (i.e. maize, wheat and rice) from these lands and crop-specific production costs. The present value of the annual land values from GTAP, computed with the same discount rate as in the World Bank study (i.e. 4%), has turned out to correlate very well for 7 out of 15 regions for which World Bank data exist: USA, South America, Northern Africa, Southern Africa, OECD Europe, Middle East and Oceania (R2=0.99; although GTAP values are about 1,000 US dollars higher than World Bank values). No data were available for Eastern Europe and Former Soviet Union. For another five regions (Canada, Western Africa, Eastern Africa, South Asia and Southeast Asia) GTAP values come to about one-third of World Bank results (at R2=0.91). For the remaining three regions (Japan, East Asia and Latin America) GTAP values are considerably higher than the World Bank values. In the sensitivity analysis we show the importance of different land costs, which are considerable. GDP per hectare of ‘useable’ area (see Table 1) is an important indicator for estimating how land costs evolve over time. The useable area is defined as the total surface area of a region minus the surface of hot desert, scrubland, tundra and ice. Adding other factors, such as population density or crop yields do not improve the correlation coefficient (of 0.74). Regional land costs over time (LCR(t)) are calculated as: where CR is a regional normalization factor to make land costs in 2001 equal to the GTAP-land values (see Table 1). Note that the period of application of carbon plantations is longer than the period of net sequestration. Therefore land costs of the complete period need to be assigned to the period in which carbon payments take place. Here, the period before cumulative carbon sequestration exceeds the sequestration of the natural vegetation is called the start-up period (spi). For fast growing tree species, such as Eucalyptus and Poplar, this period is usually 0–5 years, whereas for other species it can be 25 years or more. The annual land costs, ALCi(t), are calculated by (in $/ha/year):",347.0223

In general, the single most important cost factor in producing or conserving carbon sinks is land (Richards and Stokes 2004). Here, we consider two types of costs: land costs, and establishment costs. Various other types of costs have been evaluated but not further considered. Operation and maintenance costs, for example, costs for fertilization, thinning, security and other activities are not considered in most studies on forestry (for review, see Richards and Stokes 2004). We assume that operation and maintenance costs are either low (in the case of permanent plantations), or are compensated by revenues from timber or fuelwood (in the case of harvesting at regular time intervals) (Benítez-Ponce 2005). Likewise, transaction costs and costs of monitoring or certification are not considered since hardly any project experience is available at the time (Trines 2003).",346.011505

Because it is unknown in advance when a certain potential is actually used in a mitigation effort and to allow for comparison with other greenhouse gas mitigation options using the FAIR model (see Step 4), we average the carbon sequestration over a predefined period of time. Therefore each point in a supply curve represents the average annual carbon sequestration potential of a grid cell as assigned to a certain time interval [ts,tt], where ts is the first year the total cumulative carbon sequestration is positive and tt the final year of the simulation period. Especially in non-tropical latitudes, ts can be up to 25 years after the planting year due to soil respiration exceeding the carbon uptake, especially when trees are young. The final year tt is 2100, or, if no harvest takes place, the first year in which the annual carbon sequestration decreases below 40% of the overall average value. In case of harvest, the average carbon sequestration of a plantation between ts and tt equals the average value at the end of the simulation period. However, when this value at the end of the simulation period is less than 85% of the average value at the end of the last completed harvest cycle, we use the average carbon sequestration value at the end of the last completed harvest cycle for the whole plantation period.",346.927094

Article 2 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) states its ultimate objective as ‘Stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.’ A large number of scenario studies have been published that aim to identify mitigation strategies for achieving different stabilization levels of CO2 (e.g. Morita et al. 2001). Most of these studies have concentrated on reducing the energy-related CO2 emissions only, leaving aside abatement options that enhance CO2-uptake by the biosphere. This lack of attention to carbon sequestration in the scientific literature has been partly compensated since the Kyoto Protocol makes provisions for Annex B countries to partly achieve their reduction commitments by planting new forests or by managing existing forests or agricultural land differently. Information made available before the Third Assessment Report (TAR) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC; Metz et al. 2001) suggested that land has the technical potential to sequester an additional 87 billion ton carbon by 2050 in global forests alone (Watson et al. 2000). Since the IPCC’s TAR, many studies have addressed the possibility of carbon sequestration as part of mitigation strategies, although not many integral studies are available. Moreover, differences in terminology and scope make it difficult to compare the different carbon sequestration studies (Richards and Stokes 2004). Several sectoral studies suggest that land-based mitigation could be cost-effective compared to energy-related mitigation strategies and could provide a large proportion of total mitigation (Sohngen and Mendelsohn 2003; McCarl and Schneider 2001). However, most of these studies work on crude assumptions for future land-use change, a crucial factor determining future land availability for other purposes than carbon plantations (Graveland et al. 2002) or land for modern energy crops (Hoogwijk et al. 2005). For example, Sathaye et al. (2006) based their future projections of carbon sinks on linear extrapolation of continuing deforestation and afforestation rates, whereas Sohngen and Sedjo (2006) only considered an increase in forest product demand, discarding future food demand, which is expected to increase immensely in the coming decades (Bruinsma 2003). In this paper we present a new methodology to construct supply curves and cost–supply curves or Marginal Abatement Curves (MACs) for carbon plantations based on integrated land-use scenarios from the Integrated Model to Assess the Global Environment (IMAGE Team 2001; Strengers et al. 2004; Bouwman et al. 2006). This methodology builds on Van Minnen et al. (2007), in which a method is presented to quantify the sequestration potential of planting carbon plantations. Through this methodology, land use for food supply is taken into account and a more coherent carbon sequestration potential is obtained. Moreover, by basing the MACs on the land-use scenarios of IMAGE 2 and implementing the carbon plantations in IMAGE 2 itself, overestimation of carbon sequestration potential or unrealistic overruling of the food supply chain is not possible as it is in other studies. In these, MACs are used directly by Computable General Equilibrium models and the consequences for other land opportunities are not considered (Criqui et al. 2006; Jakeman and Fisher 2006). In Section 2 we summarize the methodology to determine the carbon sequestration potential and present the methodology to construct cost supply curves. Section 3 consists of global and regional results to emphasize the regional specificity of our methodology. Here, we also show the importance of different harvest regimes. In Section 4, we elaborate on the relative importance of different parameters in our methodology with a sensitivity analysis. In Section 5 we compare our results with other studies, and end with conclusions and recommendations.",346.93513

A sensitivity analysis for assessing which factors are most important in shaping these curves is also presented. In the IPCC SRES B2 Scenario, the carbon sequestration potential on abandoned agricultural land increases from 60 MtC/year in 2010 to 2,700 MtC/year in 2100 for prices up to 1,000 $/tC, assuming harvest when the mean annual increment decreases and assuming no environmental, economical or political barriers in the implementation-phase. Taking these barriers into consideration would reduce the potential by at least 60%. On the other hand, the potential will increase 55 to 75% if plantations on harvested timberland are considered. Taking into account land and establishment costs, the largest part of the potential up to 2025 can be supplied below 100 $/tC (In this article all dollar values are in US dollars of 1995, unless indicated otherwise.). Beyond 2050, more than 50% of the costs come to over 200 $/tC. Compared to other mitigation options, this is relative cheap. So a large part of the potential will likely be used in an overall mitigation strategy. However, since huge emission reductions are probably needed, the relative contribution of plantations will be low (around 3%). The largest source of uncertainty with respect to both potentials and costs is the growth rate of plantations compared to the natural vegetation.",346.92482

In order to be responsive to the uncertainties that lie ahead, several IPCC assessments and a recent report from the National Academy of Sciences, America’s Climate Choices (National Research Council of the National Academies 2011) recommend “iterative risk management.” Iterative risk management is essential for CDR, where uncertainty permeates every aspect. Consider three sources of uncertainty. First, uncertainty looms over the stabilization target, and, as seen in several of the papers in this issue, the extent of deployment of CDR is tightly coupled to the climate objective. In the modeling analysis in this special issue, the target-setting process is idealized as the setting of a global target very soon and its retention without modification throughout the century. This idealization is mathematically convenient, but it obviously does not capture reality. Modeling should be able to explore the robustness of early actions in a world where countries continually revise their climate change policies and targets and, through some collective process, iterate global targets (Haurie et al. 2011). Revisions in national policies and practices will reflect both the evolution of climate science and what nations learn from experience about the effectiveness of their own and other countries’ mitigation and adaptation efforts. The competitiveness of fossil fuels is a second major source of uncertainty. Oversimplifying, there are two views today about how quickly the fossil-fuel era can be brought to a close: in just a few decades or in more like a full century. Underlying this difference in views are judgments not only about the urgency of dealing with climate change but also judgment about the competitiveness of fossil fuels (without CCS), relative to low-carbon alternatives (Socolow 2012). A third uncertainty surrounds judgments about what Meadowcroft calls the “social impacts” of technology. Meadowcroft writes: “Typically it is only as a technology is rolled out into society that one can get a firm grip on the timing and strength of side effects, the operation of countervailing forces, and the mobilization of direct opposition.” For example, biological versions of CDR will undergo periodic assessment of impacts on land tenure and property rights that could affect level of deployment. Uncertainties about targets, fossil-fuel competitiveness, and social impacts of CDR are obviously linked. Analysis on behalf of iterative decision-making regarding the value of CDR will require contributions from practitioners of disciplines only minimally represented in the articles in this issue, including policy analysts, political scientists, lawyers, economists, psychologists, and sociologists. &I it f ti t CO ii d ti ti l l t lt th n pursu o s r ngen 2e em ss ons re uc on, par cu ar ya a e s ages w en much emissions reduction has already been accomplished, carbon dioxide removal (CDR) strategies could become competitive with further deployment of conventional mitigation strategies. In particular, CO2 removal could conceivably substitute for the elimination of the most recalcitrant emissions, such as those from aircraft. & To la a dominant role however CDR technolo ies would be needed in dauntin qua nti ties. It is far fro m certain  that positive gnet environmental and societa l benefits from CDR at very large scale will be achievable. For biological versions of CDRs, a full assessment will require continued improvements in understanding of the coupling of land and atmospheric impacts of bioenergy technologies. For versions of CDR requiring large amounts of CO2 sequestration, much further development of CO2 infrastructure and experience with CO2 storage will be required. & When models explore a steadfast commitment early in this century to the achieve-ment of a stringent CO2e concentration target late in the century, CDR technologies are introduced mostly late in the century. The burden of emission reductions shifts forward slightly, in favor of actions late in the century when better technology and greater global affluence are expected. As a result, the costs of mitigation are rebalanced across generations and across countries and regions. During the first half of the century, in all cases, a commitment to stringent targets requires a vigorous decarbonization of the global economy, especially in the power sector, and largely without CDR. & CDR ld b it t li t ll di th t h i CO t ti cou e ns rumen a n ac ua y re uc ng e a mosp er c 2e concen ra on and the associated globally averaged surface temperature, once fossil-fuel-based CO2 emissions have been largely eliminated. However, CDR on its own can reduce the atmospheric CO2 concentrations only very slowly: think, 1 ppm/yr. A CDR campaign actually to reverse climate damage, ifit could be done at all, would probably extend over a century or more. & The modeling of CDR in integrated assessments can be enriched by further iterative dialog with other disciplines. It is not too early to foster communication among those who model optimized century-scale responses to climate change, those who are scoping the opportunities and challenges associated with CDR technologies, and those who are thinking about policy instruments.",346.93339

Threats can be chronic or acute. A chronic threat could take the form of a “new normal” in climate that is widely judged to be unfavorable, relative to an earlier climate. An acute threat would be a “climate emergency”: the sudden appearance of a dangerous manifestation of climate change that threatens to overwhelm civilization. To counter a chronic threat, CDR may be used someday to lower the atmospheric CO2 concentration. At such a time nearly all fossil fuel emissions would have ended. How quickly could the CO2 concentration be reduced? As summarized in Table 1, the papers in this issue contemplate CDR at 15 to 30 GtCO2/yr by 2100. Conservatively, at this rate of deployment, the CO2e concentration will fall by 1 to 2 ppm/yr (see above). Think 550 ppm being lowered to 450 ppm over 50 to 100 years. In short, CDR could be matched to a globally coordinated deliberative process that adjusts the atmospheric concentration on a century-scale. CDR, however, is not matched to a climate emergency, which is likely to require that an effective response be mounted over a decade or so. Examples ofemergencies are rapid melting of the Greenland icesheet and rapid outgassing of methane now sequestered in buried ice in structures known as clathrates. It is possible, however, that a sufficiently rapid response could be generated by Solar Radiation Management (SRM). The objective of SRM strategies is to increase the percent ofincoming sunlight reflected by the planet (e.g., from its current value of 31 % to 32 %), thereby countering the warming by greenhouse gases. Strategies to increase the planet’s reflectivity include making clouds whiter and injecting reflective particles into the stratosphere. Often today CDR and SRM are presented as two versions of“geoengineering”—a word intended to encompass all forms of deliberate intervention in the earth’s physical, chemical, and biological systems at the planetary scale (Royal Society 2009).",345.87258

Integrated assessment modeling, for example, embeds constraints that prevent one component of the energy system, such as nuclear power, from displacing all its competitors in a single decade, even if the model introduces a technological breakthrough that suddenly lowers this alternative’s cost. Necessarily, judgment is required to quantify constraints on pace. History can help by providing evidence bearing on the time required, for example, for one energy alternative (such as automobiles) to displace another (such as horses). Nothing happens overnight. Pace for the biological CDR options is constrained by how quickly land use can change. In the reference case (T1) in Edmonds et al., a uniform price on biological and fossil fuel carbon of $16/tCO2 ($60/tC) is imposed in 2015–2020, which “dramatically changes the economics of land use and dramatically changes the allocation of land in the model.” (See Edmonds et al., Supporting Online Material.) As a result, in that same initial time step, no less than one billion hectares of land “change use to forest systems predominantly, but not exclusively, in the tropics.” This is the land area of the United States. On average, each hectare undergoing afforestation is sequestering 4 tC/yr (15 tCO2) by 2020, resulting in a new land sink of 15 GtCO2/yr that cancels roughly half of the world’s fossil fuel emissions. The average “pace” of this rapid increase is 3 GtCO2/yr2. Bottlenecks that might constrain land use change on one billion hectares in a five-year period that begins just two years from now are not internal to this specific mitigation strategy in this specific model. To take pace into account and penalize overly rapid deployment, Kriegler et al. introduces “adjustment costs” on the rate of capacity expansion. Van Vuuren et al. observes that the “emission reduction rate” (our “pace”) is constrained by the cost of “premature retirement” as well as “the inertia in the change of consumer preferences, international negotiation processes, policy formulation and the maximum deployment rate of new technologies… These factors are very uncertain and typically not captured in energy-economic models.” Meadowcroft, contemplating large-scale CDR quite generally, writes: “Scale must also be thought about in terms of the human activity required to realize the approach, the scope of existing societal practices that must be transformed, the land-use footprint and potential environmental impacts. And this suggests ambitious estimates of CDR potentials—especially by mid-century—must be viewed with caution.” All CDR modeling will eventually take pace into account. For DAC, constraints on pace arise from limits on the rate of build-up, globally, of specific industrial activity, such as cement or steel production, and the fraction of such a build-up that could be dedicated to DAC. Historical precedents might be sought in the rates of build-up observed during wartime mobilization or, perhaps, in the rates of increase in specific industrial sectors (such as road and building construction) during the recent period of high economic growth in China. The CDR pace can be quantified in the units of the “stabilization wedge” (Pacala and Socolow 2004; Socolow and Lam 2007). A wedge is defined by linear growth of a carbon-responsive strategy over 50 years, starting from no activity at all and rising to an activity level of 1 GtC/yr. A one-wedge pace, therefore, is 0.02 GtC/yr2, or 0.073 GtCO2/yr2. Thus, the pace of afforestation discussed above, 3 GtCO2/yr2, is a 40-wedge pace. Constraints on pace are an important challenge to modeling in general and to the modeling of CDR in particular.",345.91023

Their BECCS system is based on switchgrass grown in a temperate climate. Afforestation is modeled as 50 years of carbon build-up in tropical eucalyptus plantations. In both cases, these choices are intended only to be illustrative: to illuminate qualitative issues common to many biomass strategies and to provide templates for analogous calculations bearing on other species and locations. They estimate demands on land, water, nitrogen, and phosphorus and they identify impacts on albedo, biodiversity, and land tenure. All quantitative estimates are scaled, helpfully, to a global enterprise removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere at a rate of 3.7 GtCO2/yr (1 GtC/yr). Here, we report a few of their sobering results. The key estimate is the productivity of land, i.e., the yield in tons per hectare-year (t/ha-yr). For the Smith & Torn switchgrass plantation producing feedstock for BECCS, the estimated yield is 5.6 to 23 tbiomass/ha-yr. Note that the high estimate is four times larger than the low estimate. Assuming that the carbon intensity of energy from switchgrass is 15 GJ/tbiomass, the estimated yield of primary energy in the form of switchgrass feedstock (rounding off) is 80 to 350 GJ/ha-yr. Compare this range with the primary biomass energy yield at the end of the century assumed for two scenarios in Edmonds et al., 600 GJ/ha-yr (about 300 EJ/yr grown on about 500 Mha, see Table 2). A rate of improvement of yields of 0.6 %/yr to 2.3 %/yr for 90 years would be required for Smith & Torn’s estimated yield today to grow to the yield in 2100 in Edmonds et al. This range brackets the 1.6 %/yr long-run record of yield improvement reported by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. The “net carbon” issues for DAC explored in Mazzotti et al. reappear in the BECCS system examined by Smith & Torn. The authors estimate that about 2.2 tons of carbon must be fixed in switchgrass by photosynthesis for each ton of carbon sequestered as CO2 in a geological formation via BECCS, to compensate for emissions associated with harvesting, transport, and electricity production. Smith and Torn report that switchgrass is 42 % carbon; as a result, to sequester one ton of carbon per year via BECCS will require growing 5.2 tons of biomass per year, corresponding to 0.23 to 0.94 hectares. As for land demands for afforestation at eucalyptus plantations, Smith & Torn assume that carbon builds up in trees for 50 years at an average rate of1.3 to 4.0 tC/ha-yr. Thus, each ton per year of CDR via afforestation will require 0.25 to 0.77 hectares. Evidently, in Smith & Torn, the land required for an identical level of CDR activity is nearly the same for a fiftyyear afforestation project and for BECCS. At the end of the 50 years, new land will be needed for afforestation (the eucalyptus trees will have reached maximum size), but, in principle, the land planted in switchgrass for BECCS can keep producing. If hundreds of millions of hectares are dedicated to carbon management, other land will experience knock-on effects. For example, a change from pasture to energy crop for BECCS will require that fodder be grown elsewhere and may elicit feedlot cattle-raising. These knock-on consequences are subsumed under the label, “indirect land-use change,” or “ILUC” (Searchinger et al. 2008; Fargione et al. 2008). They will have their own climate impacts—not only CO2 emissions but also changes in albedo and evapotranspiration. Including ILUC in the assessments of BECCS and afforestation was beyond the scope of Smith & Torn. Smith & Torn estimates that an average application rate of 80 kgN/ha-yr of nitrogen fertilizer is required to achieve the assumed switchgrass yields. The Smith & Torn reference CDR level of 1 GtC/yr (3.7 GtCO2/yr), therefore, will require an annual input of 19 to 75 million tons of nitrogen. By comparison, today’s annual global fertilizer production provides about 100 million tons of nitrogen. Today’s rate also roughly equals the global rate of biological fixation of atmospheric nitrogen by microorganisms. Increased nitrogen availability has fed the world, but it has also had many adverse environmental consequences, such as eutrophication of coastal waterways and increased production of nitrous oxide (N2O), a potent greenhouse gas. BECCS can be expected to exacerbate these adverse consequences, even as it retards climate change. The authors speculate, however, that future nitrogen requirements to achieve the same yield will decline as fertilizer is delivered more effectively. Hundreds of millions of hectares dedicated to biomass CDR is an immense demand on land. Integrated assessment models that call for large demands on land have long incorporated ecological constraints that reduce the scope for bio-energy in climate change mitigation (van Vuuren et al. 2009). It is already time for broad discussion of these ecological constraints and their implications. Climate mitigation modelers, land use planners, agricultural economists, agronomists, foresters, plant physiologists, and genetic engineers—this is only a partial list of those who must participate.",345.976142

Extra CO2 in the atmosphere leads to some fraction dissolving into seawater at the ocean’s surface, and a similar redistribution (though much more complicated) occurs for vegetation. Over the past several decades, on average (but with large year-to-year variation) the net atmospheric removal rate has been about half of the emissions rate from fossil fuel combustion (with roughly equal contributions from ocean and land removal). One can anticipate, therefore, that deliberate removal of CO2 from the atmosphere should be accompanied by ocean outgassing of CO2 and (with less certainty) reduction in the global stock of carbon in biomass. These are negative feedbacks on the CDR enterprise. Vichi et al. may be the first paper to estimate ocean outgassing when the CO2 is removed over an extended period of time. Cao and Caldeira estimated ocean outgassing when CO2 is removed from the atmosphere at a single moment (Cao and Caldeira 2008). Vichi et al. studies two related extended campaigns that in the absence of outgassing would remove about 490 GtCO2 (130 GtC) from the atmosphere over a 30 year period (about 16 GtCO2/yr, about half the current rate of fossil fuel emissions). As discussed in the previous section, CO2 removal rates this large and larger are foreseen by the IAMs. In the first campaign, a global CDR industry follows a prescribed emission-reduction schedule: it removes 16 GtCO2/yr for 30 years and ignores the outgassing; in response 50 GtCO2 outgases from the ocean, a 10 % negative feedback. In the second campaign, a global CDR industry follows assures that the net CO2 removal is 16 GtCO2/yr when outgassing is taken into account. This requires removing somewhat more than 16 GtCO2/yr, because the concentration difference between ocean and atmosphere is always larger; the associated outgassing is slightly greater, 66 GtCO2. The authors warn that their results are specific to an initial atmospheric concentration of CO2 of 348 ppm (the concentration in 1988) and for a specific ocean model. Nonetheless, a crude representation of outgassing in Chen & Tavoni indicates that this negative feedback can significantly reduce the scope for CDR. Although the terrestrial sink is much less well understood than the ocean sink, by a combination of measurement and modeling a coarse sketch of the geographical distribution of the terrestrial carbon sink is emerging. Eventually, models will incorporate a CDR-efficacy factor that accounts for all sources and sinks. For now, a conservative estimate—aligned with the strength of the negative feedbacks from the ocean and land observed today—would assume that a one-ton reduction in the atmospheric stock of CO2 requires two tons of CO2 to be removed from the atmosphere.",346.93664

Optimization across three variables (fraction of CO2 captured, air flow velocity, and sorbent solution velocity) reduces the estimated capture cost only slightly, because key cost assumptions for capital equipment are not changed. The cost estimate (in the range of $500 per ton of CO2) is used as an input in the integrated assessment papers by Fuss et al. and Chen & Tavoni. The APS report and Mazzotti et al. propose that CO2 removal from the atmosphere will almost certainly be substantially more expensive than reducing (by retrofit or rebuild) nearly all of the emissions from large and concentrated sources of CO2 at coal and natural gas power plants, refineries, cement plants, and many other industrial facilities. The fundamental reason is that the concentration of CO2 in the flue gas at these facilities is much higher than in air. The ratio for a coal power plant is roughly 300–12 % CO2 in the flue gas, 0.04 % in air. This ratio affects the frontal area facing the incoming gas, but this is only one of several contributors to the cost ratio. The path of flue gas at a coal plant can be longer, the percent of CO2 removed can be larger, materials can be allowed to be more expensive, and operating costs can be a higher fraction of total costs. In Mazzotti et al., the ratio of total costs is 6 to 8. Several start-up companies are seeking to reduce the cost ratio further. Lackner, for example, speculates that DAC could take the form of large numbers of low-unit-cost factory-produced absorbers. (Lackner et al. 2012) Arguably, DAC could experience greater cost reductions than flue-gas capture, because a DAC facility has only a single objective, whereas conventional CCS at a large industrial facility is an add-on, complicating and compromising the core activity (e.g., producing power). Nonetheless, it is hard to imagine a future where many coal power plants spew their CO2 into the atmosphere while, simultaneously, many DAC plants are removing CO2 from the atmosphere. It seems far more likely that DAC deployment will not begin in earnest until very few large concentrated sources remain. Perhaps DAC can expand greatly with little change in unit cost, making DAC a “backstop” technology. By contrast, BECCS will eventually reflect land constraints. More-over, DAC may require much less land per ton of CDR than BECCS and may create fewer land-use conflicts. In common, BECCS and DAC require low-cost, publicly acceptable, and abundant geological storage capacity for CO2.",346.003386

Vichi et al. raises and quantifies the important issue of ocean outgassing associated with CO2 removal from the atmosphere (Kheshgi et al. 2005). Just as CO2 emissions into the atmosphere result in CO2 passing from the atmosphere to the ocean to sustain equilibrium at the ocean’s surface, so too do flows from ocean to atmosphere accompany atmospheric removal. Chen & Tavoni incorporates the results of Vichi et al. Smith & Torn presents a systematic quantitative discussion of inputs to biological CDR strategies: land, nitrogen, phosphorus, and water. The authors also quantify the CO2 and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions associated with these inputs; emissions of N2O, a potent greenhouse gas, are sensitive to nitrogen inputs and have received little attention. The falling water table usually associated with afforestation is also discussed, as well as soil salination and biodiversity. This paper adds an important dimension to CDR research and raises the prospect that biological versions of CDR may largely transfer environmental risk from the atmosphere to the land.

The extent of late CDR and associated reduction in early conventional effort depends on the discount rate. The discount rate captures the willingness to transfer mitigation costs to future generations that will also face higher climate damages. Lowering the discount rate indeed reduces the scope for CDR in Chen & Tavoni.

Table 1 presents results for CDR as a whole, and Table 2 presents results for BECCS. Table 1 shows that cumulative CDR for the 21st century is on the order of 1000 GtCO2, bracketed by 500 GtCO2 and 1600 GtCO2. By comparison, currently, the annual emissions rate from fossil fuels is 30 GtCO2/yr and the atmosphere contains 3000 GtCO2. In Edmonds et al. the ranges for estimated 21st century CDR from afforestation and BECCS overlap; similarly, Chen & Tavoni allows both BECCS and DAC and finds comparable contributions. Cumulative CDR activity represents a substantial fraction of total estimated mitigation over the century, roughly 3500 to 4000 GtCO2e for stringent climate targets. A CDR contribution of 1000 GtCO2 reduces the equilibrium average surface temperature about 0.5 °C, according to the carbon budget approach (Matthews et al. 2012). The peak rate of CDR activity is similar across all five models, ranging from 10 to 35 GtCO2/yr. In Edmonds et al., but not in the other four IAM papers, CDR enters significantly early in the century. It enters in the form of afforestation, which quickly becomes competitive with other mitigation options, because terrestrial carbon emissions are penalized and rewarded at the same carbon price as fossil-fuel carbon emissions. The result is early, large, and widespread changes in land-use practices. In summary, the IAM models show that when strong targets for carbon mitigation are pursued, CDR technologies costing between $100/tCO2 and $1000/tCO2 contribute substantially to climate-change mitigation in the second halfofthe century. Some high-cost mitigation options are never deployed. In the final period of the 21st century, for the reference case in Fuss et al., one-third of baseline emissions remain unmitigated. In effect, residual emissions enter the atmosphere at one location, and at other locations a net-cumulative-emissions target is met by CDR that removes nearly an equivalent amount of CO2. Overshoots are reported for three ofthe five models. They are much smaller in Kriegler et al. and Chen & Tavoni (40 ppm and 60 ppm for concentration overshoot, 0.05 °C and 0.06 °C for temperature overshoot, respectively) than in Edmonds et al. (where the overshoot ranges are 55 ppm to 135 ppm and 0.2 °C to 0.5 °C). The disparities in the ratio oftemperature overshoot to concentration overshoot across these three papers reflect differences in the timing of CDR implementation and the lagged relationship between concentration and temperature. As seen in Table 2, in 2100 the bioenergy contribution to global primary energy ranges from 100 to 300 EJ/yr, across the five papers. By comparison the models estimate roughly 1000 EJ/yr of total global primary energy at that time. Not all of the bioenergy will appear as BECCS, since some will be for biofuels and some will be for biopower without CCS. Table 2 also reports land requirements of several hundred million hectares (Mha) for biological CDR for the two IAM models that include land explicitly: Edmonds et al. reports 490 Mha and 530 Mha for two scenarios where land is assigned to both afforestation and BECCS, while van Vuuren et al. estimates from 300 Mha to 600 Mha, all for BECCS. BECCS is first implemented early in the century (around 2030), but most CDR via BECCS is achieved after 2050, when deep cuts in emissions are needed and carbon prices exceed $100/tCO2. However, BECCS is adversely affected by the rising cost ofbiomass that reflects its constrained supply. As seen in Table 2, biomass prices in 2100 for three baseline cases without BECCS are between $3/GJ and 8$/GJ, similar to the models’ prices today. But when BECCS is available for the same targets, it produces dramatic upward pressure on the biomass price, which increases to 31–94 $/GJ, depending on marginal production costs and scarcity rents.",346.06998

Limited geological storage capacity for CO2 produces another constraint. The total global CO2 storage capacity, assuming minimal problems with public acceptance, ranges from 2100 GtCO2 in Fuss et al. to 7000 GtCO2 in Edmonds et al.—in all cases ample for century-scale conventional fossil-fuel-based CCS, BECCS, and DAC. However, regional storage constraints do arise and give regions with large storage potential a competitive advantage in conducting CDR, provided inter-regional CO2 transport is absent.

Four are well established state-of-the-art IAMs: GCAM (Edmonds et al. 2013), IMAGE (Van Vuuren et al. 2013), REMIND (Kriegler et al. 2013) and WITCH (Chen and Tavoni 2013). The fifth (Fuss et al. 2013) is an original, stylized model tailored to answer specific questions about the interaction of CDR deployment with uncertainties in the magnitude of the climate change threat. The four IAMs are century-scale models that either simulate (GCAM and IMAGE) or optimize (REMIND and WITCH) a cost-effective strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In the simulation models equilibria are developed for each point in time, while for the optimization models the whole temporal dynamics is resolved at once, assuming a forward-looking planner with perfect foresight who discounts future wellbeing. In all cases the target is a concentration of CO2e not to be exceeded in 2100. The target concentration is not exactly equal across papers, but it is stringent and roughly in line with an increase of the average surface temperature capped at 2.0 °C to 2.5 °C. Importantly, the concentration objective can be exceeded at intermediate times, because subsequently CDR can reduce the CO2 concentration. Climate feedbacks on these trajectories are not included in the models. Thus, incremental damage during overshoot periods is not taken into account. Damage-trajectory relationships are complex, because damage is associated with both short-term forcing (which impacts meteorology) and integrated forcing (which affects large-time-constant behavior such as icesheet melting and ocean warming). With a slightly lower concentration in 2100 than in 2070, for example, should one expect to see any reduction by 2100 of the storm severity and ice melting seen in 2070? The technological resolution of CDR varies across the models. Edmonds et al. and Van Vuuren et al. model “yield” (biomass production per hectare per year) and land area. Only Edmonds et al. develops the biomass energy supply from a model (GCAM) that fully couples the economy, energy, and land use. The other models rely on a soft coupling to the land and introduce cost curves for bioenergy supply exogenously. As summarized in Table 1, four CDR strategies are explored by at least one model. All models give prominence to biological energy production with CO2 capture and storage (BECCS). Edmonds et al. also includes afforestation and storage ofcarbon in materials (such as plastics). Both Chen & Tavoni and Fuss et al. include Direct Air Capture of CO2 with chemicals (DAC). These four strategies illuminate many of the key issues raised by CDR, notably co-benefits, gross vs. net emissions, and demands on land. Among the CDR strategies that are not explored at all are ocean-based strategies such as iron fertilization and land-based strategies such as biochar. From the perspective of integrated assessment modeling, the CDR options are just another set of technologies for mitigating climate change, competing with the usual list of strategies, such as efficiency, renewables, CCS, and nuclear power. Cost trajectories and quantity constraints for the CDR strategies are the key new information introduced into the models. This competition is particularly transparent in Fuss et al., where the assumed cost of removing a marginal percent of baseline CO2 emissions is constant over time but depends exponentially on the percent already removed: the marginal costs ofabating 25 %, 50 %, and 75 % of baseline emissions are, respectively, about $10/tCO2, $100/tCO2, and $1000/tCO2. The four IAMs disaggregate the world into macro-regions (roughly 12–14 macro regions for all models except IMAGE, which has twice as many) which interact through trading. Edmonds et al. and Chen & Tavoni explore both differential regional compliance with global agreements and differential regional endowments affecting CDR capability (such as geological storage capacity). In Edmonds et al. and Chen & Tavoni, delayed participation can result in regional emissions that exceed some pre-specified cumulative global emissions, making the corresponding CO2e concentration target unobtainable. As a consequence of differential endowments, Chen & Tavoni expects BECCS to be implemented primarily in Latin America and assigns DAC especially to the transition economies and the MENA region (Middle East and North Africa). Edmonds et al. sees China, the U.S., and Latin America dominating, when CDR includes both afforestation and BECCS.",346.90656

Through these articles modelers will learn about the incompleteness ofcurrent understanding ofthe CDR option, and those involved in characterizing CDR science and technology will appreciate the questions modelers need help answering. Encouraged by Carlo Carraro, coordinator ofclimate change research at Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei (FEEM) and Euro-Mediterranean Center on Climate Change (CMCC), we organized a meeting in Venice in May, 2011, to bring these perspectives together. In this special issue of Climatic Change most of the papers from that workshop have become articles. CDR is important because it empowers “overshoot” trajectories (den Elzen and van Vuuren 2007). An overshoot trajectory achieves a CO2e concentration target at a specific future time while exceeding that target during some intermediate time. Due to CO2 absorption by the natural land and ocean sinks, overshoot is possible even without CDR. The engineered sinks probed in these models supplement these natural sinks. Indeed, when CDR technologies are cost-competitive and the atmospheric CO2e concentration is tightly constrained at some distant date (usually 2100), an overshoot trajectory often emerges. To be sure, the overshoot period could bring irreversible damage that would not have occurred if the target for 2100 had never been exceeded. Overshoot trajectories and associated CDR strategies are closely linked to the feasibility of long-term climate stabilization policies. In the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) of the IPCC most of the scenarios focused on targets where 550–650 CO2e never to be exceeded, and only a few scenarios focused on more stringent targets. With AR5, policymakers asked modelers to focus on stringent objectives like the “two degrees” target, where the planet’s average surface temperature never exceeds its preindustrial value (200 years ago) by more than 2 °C. The AR4 scenarios with stringent targets featured CDR and were new to the modeling community, which became concerned that AR4 would be read as biased favorably toward the feasibility of the 2 °C target (Tavoni and Tol 2010). Subsequently, many models have incorporated CDR, thereby increasing the options for achieving stringent climate targets. Thus, paradoxically, despite little progress in international climate policy and increasing emissions, long-term climate stabilization through the lens of IAM appears easier and less expensive. CDR allows the mitigation burden to shift away from early periods. Clearly, it matters whether substantial overshooting via CDR is a credible proposition. A CDR strategy necessarily requires moving atmospheric carbon elsewhere. In the articles in this volume, “elsewhere” is either the biosphere (whose carbon stock thereby increases) or porous geological formations deep below ground. The method of removal of atmospheric carbon is either photosynthesis or air flow across inorganic chemical sorbents. Three of the four resulting options are explored in this issue: 2) Biological capture and geological storage – an option known BECCS (Biological Energy production with associated geological Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage). In BECCS, an energy crop is produced, harvested, and converted into either electricity or fuel; much of the CO2 generated at the energy conversion site is captured and stored. A carbon atom removed from the atmosphere by photosynthesis is sent below ground, and the atmosphere is scrubbed of some of its CO2. 3) Non-biological capture and geological storage – an option known as DAC (Direct Air Capture of Carbon dioxide with chemicals). In DAC, air flows over a chemical sorbent which preferentially removes CO2, and the resulting concentrated CO2 is injected deep underground.",346.93532

Detailed descriptions ofthe SSP implementations in all participating frameworks are available as part ofa special issue on the quantification ofthe SSPs–, with overview papers showing a comparison ofresults  as well as a synthesis ofkey insights related to the energy system  and land use . An overview ofmodel documentation, including the native regional resolution ofthe models and extensive references, is available in appendix D ofref. 5. Supplementary Table 1 provides a succinct overview ofthe modelling frameworks and key references.",247.460506

Participating modelling teams were asked to provide scenarios that comply with specific modelling characteristics and that are derived with the same models, model versions and assumptions as used for the SSPs  (see below). The modelling protocol consisted ofa set ofsimulations in which total anthropogenic radiative forcing in 2100 is limited to 1.9 Wm−. The limit of 1.9 Wm− is evaluated with the simple carbon-cycle and climate model MAGICC (Model for the Assessment ofGreenhouse Gas Induced Climate Change)58 in a setup comparable to the initial setup used for the RCPs . The 1.9 Wm− limit was selected to result in at least 0.3°C ofglobal mean temperature increase difference with corresponding 2.6Wm− scenarios, which would be consistent with at least 50% ofthe global land surface experiencing statistically significant changes in temperatures . The 1.9Wm− limit is achieved in the IAMs by adjusting the CO2-equivalent carbon price. This means that the radiative forcing target is achieved through reductions in GHG emissions and related co-emissions, but not through intentional increases in aerosol emissions or solar radiation management. Scenarios are run for all SSPs available in each respective modelling framework, and with their corresponding Shared Climate Policy Assumptions , which influence the regional and sectorial application ofCO2-equivalent carbon prices (see appendices in ref. 5). Scenarios are labelled with the forcing target identifier '1.9' in combination with the respective SSP identifier, for example, SSP1–1.9 for a 1.9Wm− scenario with SSP1 assumptions. For each SSP, a marker implementation was selected, which represents the characteristics ofthat SSP particularly well . If appropriate, insights are drawn from a comparison ofmarker scenarios only. As was the case with RCP and SSP construction, no account ofclimate feedbacks to human activities and associated emissions is taken into account in the scenarios reported here.",247.64427

The IPCC AR5 assessed pathways that limited radiative forcing in 2100 to 2.6Wm−, allowing a higher level during the century . This level was deemed likely (>66% probability) to limit global-mean temperature rise to below 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels by 210053. There are various motivations to explore even more stringent scenarios. For example, in several regions and particular subsystems, such as tropical coral reefs, the impacts for a global average temperature rise of2°C can already be considerably large . Recent research has also reported discernible differences in climate impacts between a world that is 1.5°C or 2°C warmer , and these future impacts depend on the evolution ofboth the climate and the socio-economic system. Our scenarios provide a quantification ofthese dimensions for worlds that are 1.5°C warmer, and can serve as a starting point for further research by other communities, such as, for example, the adaptation, water or sustainable development communities. The scenarios presented here are an extension ofefforts to provide scenarios for the integrated assessment ofclimate-change-related challenges : the SSP scenario matrix framework . Studies already use these narratives to explore the actions required to limit radiative forcing in 2100 to levels varying from 8.5Wm− down to 2.6Wm− (refs 5,913,16,31,35,47–), and their detailed emissions and land-use developments  serve as inputs for CMIP6 ScenarioMIP , as well as other MIPs .",248.2599

The novelty of our approach is to combine within a consistent framework bottom-up modules with a macroeconomic top-down model. This allows us to represent the interactions between technical change at the sectoral, intersectoral and macro-level, with a focus on energy efficiency in non-energy productive sectors. We thus model the evolution of the production frontier while overcoming the limitations of the standard aggregate production function. Energy efficiency is endogenously modelled via (i) substitution and learning by doing in energy supply technologies; (ii) price-induced investment decisions in technologies for mobility and residential energy demand; and (iii) price-induced energy demand in productive sectors. This study features scenarios with alternatives on (iii) to analyze the role of energy efficiency in productive sectors. We investigate the channels through which energy use and prices impact economic growth in a carbon-constrained world, looking at the interplay between energy efficiency policies and the timing of climate action. Energy efficiency improvements in productive sectors reduce energy requirements in these sectors while increasing output, as was illustrated in the case of industry. Lower energy costs reduce the price of non-energy goods and drive demand, which coincides with higher employment, wages and revenues. The obvious result that enhancing energy efficiency in productive sectors results in lower energy consumption and lifts the emission constraint in these sectors conceals the less obvious result that the constraint is shifted away from household energy use. Higher final energy use in the residential sector is driven by higher household revenues and lower energy prices. Higher emissions from transport are induced by higher mobility and higher CO2 intensity of transport, driven by larger automobile use due to lower petrol prices and higher income. By lowering the carbon price signal, energy efficiency improvements act as a shield to protect household consumption ofenergy, non-energy goods and mobility from stringent emission constraints. Energy-saving technical change combined with technology diffusion drive economic growth in baseline scenarios, where a high level of GDP coincides with a low level of final energy consumption, hence a low final energy intensity of GDP over the whole period. Innovation in energy efficiency drives final energy intensity in the long term, while the pace of technology diffusion sets its level in the medium term. Energy efficiency improvements in productive sectors can greatly reduce the costs of climate mitigation, but only when energy efficiency policies in industrialised regions are combined with specific measures to accelerate technology transfers towards industrialising countries. In fact, the slow diffusion of energy efficient technologies greatly increases these costs. Energy efficiency policies aimed at innovation and knowledge diffusion drive economic growth and reduce climate change mitigation costs. Early climate action acts as a trigger of energy efficiency improvements and partly compensates for slow technology transfers. However, the timing of climate action reveals the trade-off between short and long term costs. Early action shows relatively high short term costs and should be considered in combination with ambitious policies to accelerate technology diffusion. By contrast, late climate action results in relatively high long term costs, even when combined with policy measures to enhance the energy efficiency of leader regions and accelerate technology transfers. Early and late climate actions show similar economic costs with social discount rates of 4 to 5%. They may therefore be considered as equivalent options for policy design. However, the exploratory scenarios presented here show that early action reduces the spread ofdiscounted policy costs across discount rates from 0% to 10%. This result, which should be confirmed by a full uncertainty analysis, hints at favouring early action as a robust strategy if policy makers disagree on the appropriate discount rate for assessing climate policies. Several limitations should be addressed in future work. The non-energy productive sectors are modelled in a very aggregate manner. Further modelling should therefore focus on adding a detailed bottom-up disaggregation of industry, services and agriculture production processes to refine the representation of energy efficiency. This study focused on the mechanisms of the interaction between energy efficiency improvements and economic growth. Also, a sensitivity analysis should be carried out to refine the analysis on the option value of energy efficiency for global climate mitigation strategies as well as for economic growth. Finally, the labour productivity should be endogenized to examine these issues with a fully endogenous growth engine. In particular, the link between energy efficiency, capital deepening and labour productivity should be further examined.",221.260717

This discussion echoes the conclusion of the IPCC that when choosing between mitigation strategies, policy makers must weigh the potential costs of early action against the risk of delaying abatement [101]. If early action always appears more favourable in the long term while late action always appears favourable in the short term, a relevant question is therefore how we value present and future costs to choose between both options today. Policy-makers who use social discount rates of 4 to 5% will consider early and late climate actions as equivalent options based on their economic costs. In that case, one option cannot be favoured over the other on a mere option value basis, according to our results. The trade-off between early and late actions should be considered in view of other policy levers. Late climate action results in relatively high long term policy costs, even when combined with policy measures that enhance the energy efficiency of leader regions and that accelerate the convergence of other regions towards the leader. The results presented in Section 4 illustrate the impact of decarbonising productive sectors through improved energy efficiency on the carbon intensity of the transportation and residential sectors. Additional measures to mitigate the long term costs of late action could include policies aimed at altering the structure of household demand for energy services, particularly infrastructure policies in the transport sector. Indeed, the structure of household demand is a significant driver of long term costs due to the high level of inertia of the capital stock: housing and transport infrastructures are long-lived and shifting to a low carbon capital stock may take decades. Reducing the carbon intensity in these sectors through policies complementary to carbon pricing (e.g., incentives to public transport) could therefore reduce the effect of the carbon constraint on these sectors.",221.86645

For that purpose, two emission profiles are tested (Appendix B), both corresponding to RCP 3.7. The late action trajectory is identical to the emission constraint used in the first part ofthe study. It imposes relatively weak efforts until 2030 but stringent efforts in the longer term. By contrast, the early action trajectory imposes stronger efforts in the short term, allowing for less stringent efforts in the longer term to reach the same carbon budget. Fig. 7 presents the results of this study. In all scenarios, the early action profile commands higher CO2 prices in the short term compared to the late action case, but significantly lower CO2 prices in the longer term. High short term CO2 prices have triggered the early decarbonisation of the economy. Technical systems are better prepared to abate emissions and face a slower decarbonisation constraint in the medium term. The results show that even in the case of early climate action, a very energy efficient leader does not reduce climate costs if other regions converge only slowly towards that level (high slow early vs. low slow early). However, early action removes the ambiguity between fast and slow convergence in the case of a relatively inefficient leader, as faster convergence is then superior to slow convergence for discount rates above 2% (the gap between low slow late and low fast late as compared to the gap between low slow early and low fast early). Early action thus acts as a trigger of energy efficiency improvements in the case of a relatively inefficient leader (as confirmed in Appendix D.1). This result is confirmed by comparing the relative contributions to emission reductions of energy efficiency improvements and carbon intensity reductions in early and late action scenarios. The Kaya decomposition shows a larger contribution of energy efficiency improvements in early action compared to late action in all cases. Early action erases the differences in terms of the relative contribution of carbon intensity reduction and energy efficiency due to the speed of convergence of the followers. When comparing energy efficiency assumptions, the only robust result across all discount rates is the superiority of the scenario combining a very energy efficient leader and fast convergence of other regions towards the leader (cf. Fig. 7d, detailed table in Appendix D.2). More precisely, when looking at the long term costs of late action, policies targeted at enhancing energy efficiency improvements in leader regions and allowing the fast transfer of technologies among regions would compensate for high long-term costs induced by late action combined with a low rate of innovation in the leading countries. In all cases, early action expectedly reduces discounted losses at low discount rates (long-term focus — up to 4%) and increases discounted losses at high discount rates (short-term focus — from 5%). Early action thus shows relatively high short term costs and should be considered in combination with ambitious policies to accelerate technology diffusion. Early climate action reduces the spread of discounted costs of all scenarios across discount rates (3.2–7.9%) compared to late action scenarios (2.3–10.8%), and shows significantly lower maximum losses over the considered discount rates. This result shows that early action should be preferred given the controversy surrounding the appropriate discount rate for assessing climate policies.",221.23413

While energy efficiency improvements are clearly beneficial over the period in terms of economic growth, the results have shown their heterogeneous effect in terms of the timing of sectoral emissions. This section investigates the role of the timing of specific policies to induce energy efficiency improvements. 5.1.1. On baselines As described in Section 3, the energy efficiency of all productive sectors evolves as a function of the energy price index. The relationship between energy efficiency and economic growth is further examined by looking at the influence of energy efficiency in the leader and follower regions on economic growth in baseline scenarios. Two types of parameters are thus considered: the rate of energy efficiency improvements of the leader region at fixed energy prices and the speed of convergence in other regions towards the level of energy efficiency of productive sectors in the leader region. Four scenarios are examined combining alternatives on the exogenous trend at fixed energy prices for the leader (low or high) and on the speed of followers' convergence (slow or fast). GDP is an endogenous result in our model (see Section 3.1.2). Our baseline GDP was calibrated by adapting the exogenous trends of labour productivity following the study protocol [82]. In our scenarios, baseline GDP grows between 2.1% and 2.2% per year over 2010–2100, following an intermediate pathway compared to the SRES scenarios [83]. The economy benefits from energy efficiency improvements in productive sectors in baseline scenarios, with a gain of 0.1% average economic growth over 2010–2100 between lowest and highest energy efficiency scenarios. Over the whole period, a high level of GDP coincides with a low level of final energy consumption, resulting in a low final energy intensity of GDP. The 2010–2100 average economic growth rate (i.e. the point corresponding to year 2100 in Fig. 5b) is influenced by the rate of energy efficiency improvements of the leader and is independent from the speed of convergence. This is explained by the fact that regardless of the speed of convergence, all followers aim at the level of the leader. In fact, the speed of convergence determines the level of the final energy intensity of GDP in the medium term while the level of the leader determines the final energy intensity of GDP in the long term. 5.1.2. On climate policy scenarios Fig. 6 presents instantaneous and discounted GDP losses for slow and fast convergence. In the case of slow convergence, a higher level of energy efficiency in the leader region does not reduce climate policy costs. In the case of fast convergence however, high energy efficiency of the leader greatly reduces costs for all discount rates. This result suggests that innovation in energy efficiency in industrialised regions would reduce the global costs of climate policy only if combined with specific measures targeted at technology transfers in industrialising regions. Empirical studies report such effects for CDM projects, for instance in wind power [84] and steel production [85]. [86] hints at the potential gains allowed by energy efficiency from technology diffusion from the most efficient country. [87–89] review implemented CDM project documentation and find that 40% of projects involved technology diffusion, mainly occurring in the energy and industry sectors. Latecomers can catch up with technological innovations of industrialised countries through leapfrogging [90,91]. Successful technological leapfrogging has occurred in emerging Asian countries, for instance the Korean steel [92] and car industries [93] and wind power in China and India [94–96]. The standardisation of transportation fuels in South America is another successful example [97,98]. Besides, R&D agreements may improve the efficiency of international climate cooperation [99,100]. In our study, faster convergence always reduces policy costs in the case of an energy efficient leader. The speed of convergence however has non-trivial effects on the timing of climate mitigation costs in the case of a relatively inefficient leader. Slow convergence translates into a higher carbon price until 2040 and induces short term losses compared to the fast convergence case. After that date costs are lower in the slow convergence scenario (Fig. 7). Indeed, with a slower convergence, a larger contribution to emission reductions is required from the transportation and residential sectors to meet the emission constraint. This commands higher CO2 prices, which affect economic output, as described in Section 4. When looking at discounted costs,  the benefits of fast convergence remain ambiguous for the case of an inefficient leader: slower convergence induces higher discounted costs when focusing on the short term and lower discounted costs when focusing on the long term (cf. Appendix D.2). This directly relates to the evolution of the CO2 price mentioned above. This result points",221.228817

The mechanisms described above occur in all productive sectors (Appendix C.1). Lower energy use reduces production costs through lower (tax-exclusive) energy prices and lower carbon prices, hence driving demand for all non-energy goods and consumption,  while allowing for higher energy use in transportation and residential sectors. Energy efficiency improvements thus act as a shield to protect household consumption of energy, non-energy goods and mobility from higher prices induced by stringent emission constraints. Energy efficiency improvements in productive sectors reduce total final energy consumption, primary energy and electricity production (Fig. 4). Energy efficiency also reduces labour requirements in energy sectors. However, higher demand for non-energy goods drives overall employment, which, together with higher wages in all productive sectors,  triggers a virtuous circle of higher demand driven by higher revenues. In the IMACLIM-R modelling framework, economic growth is driven by endogenous mechanisms associated with the functioning of energy and labour markets. Growth may thus depart from its natural rate, as described in Section 3.1.2. In the climate scenarios considered, high energy efficiency result in higher GDP and consumption overall (Fig. 4). The impact of energy efficiency on growth and costs is further examined in Section 5.",221.25916

Both effects act to lower tax-inclusive energy prices (Fig. 1b in Appendix C.7). Energy efficiency improvements therefore result in lower energy prices in all regions. Finally, higher energy efficiency in productive sectors result in lower overall production costs of industrial goods, leading to an increase in industrial production in terms of quantities (+29%) and output (+3%). 4.3.2. Non-energy costs Energy efficiency improvements affect the economy through the transmission oflower energy prices – as compared to low energy efficiency scenario – to all sectors, through the input–output matrix in the general equilibrium framework. Higher industrial output (measured in US$, Appendix C.1) requires higher input of non-energy goods (+18% in 2050). Higher total input ofnon-energy goods in value terms (+5% in 2050) occurs despite lower unitary costs of non-energy goods (−17% in 2050) in the high energy efficiency scenario. Lower unitary costs may be attributed to two separate effects relating to energy requirements and prices. First, lower energy requirements in all productive sectors (i.e. industry, services, agriculture and construction) decrease the costs of producing non-energy goods, which lowers their price. Second, lower (tax-inclusive) prices of non-energy goods (such as industry) also decrease the production cost and price of other non-energy goods. 4.3.5. The interaction between energy efficiency and economic output The results presented in Tables B, C and D (in Appendix C.4) account for general equilibrium effects, and therefore include demand changes and intersectoral adjustments. In 2050, high energy efficiency result in lower energy expenditures (−46%), higher non-energy expenditures (+5%), labour costs (+17%), profits (+10%) and taxes (+14%) in the high energy efficiency scenario, for a higher total output (+3%). This hides a large increase of production (+29%). Unitary expenditures decrease for all items: energy (−58%), non-energy (− 18%), labour (−9%), profits (−15%), and taxes (−11%), leading to a price decrease of −20%. In summary, lower energy consumption results in lower production costs and lower prices of industrial goods which drives up industrial output, hence household revenues through increased labour requirements and wages. These results illustrate the virtuous circle created by energy efficiency improvements in this energy-intensive sector. These results hold for a set of scenarios with technology variants (including differing assumptions on the availability of nuclear, renewables, coal resources, CCS, bioenergy and electric vehicles). For instance, we show the positive effect of energy efficiency improvements on industrial output in all these scenarios (see the sensitivity analysis in Appendix C.6). 4.3.3. Labour costs Higher industrial output also entails higher labour requirements in physical terms (the production of more goods requires the increase of the number of hours worked or the increase of the number of workers). As each sector's labour requirements are determined by an exogenous trend of unitary labour productivity over time, they directly follow sectoral output. Following the wage curve specification (see Section 3.1), higher labour requirements in productive sectors (and in the economy overall) result in lower unemployment and higher wages. However, unitary labour costs decrease (−9% in 2050), as wages are indexed on a consumer price index which decreases following energy efficiency improvements. 4.3.4. Profits Investments in energy efficiency improvements are paid for by an increase of the mark-up rate (cf. Section 3.2.1), which induces higher margins,  following Eq. (1). Overall global investments are higher in the high energy efficiency scenario (2.0% average growth rate, compared to 1.9% in the low energy efficiency case). Higher investments from households are explained by higher household revenues (Fig. 4), driven by higher employment and wages,  while higher investments from firms are driven by higher economic output and higher mark-up rates in most regions and over most of the period .

It illustrates the economic channels through which energy efficiency lowers unitary energy consumption and impacts industrial output, as presented in Fig. 1, and economic growth. Industrial output (measured in US$) can be divided into five types of expenditures: energy intermediate consumption, intermediate consumption of non-energy goods, labour costs, profits  and production taxes. Eq. (1) presents this decomposition.  Each component is examined in turn to explain the drivers of industrial production growth. The impact of energy efficiency assumptions on each component  is summarised in Tables B, C and D for industry (in Appendix C.4). 4.3.1. Energy costs The direct effect of energy efficiency improvements in industry is to decrease the required energy input for the production of industrial goods, e.g. one ton of steel (ICunitaryener in toe/ton of Steel). From a sectoral viewpoint (independent-ly of any general equilibrium or intertemporal effect), energy efficiency improvements translate into lower unitary energy costs (ICener in $/ton of Steel). Lower unitary energy costs in turn reduce overall production costs. Energy efficiency improvements have two indirect effects on economic output. First, higher energy efficiency lowers global energy consumption,  which relaxes tensions on energy markets and results in lower tax-exclusive energy prices in the first half of the period (Fig. 1a in Appendix C.7).",221.20572

The response of economic sectors to this constraint is heterogeneous, as some sectors may be easier to decarbonise than others.  The contribution of carbon and energy intensity improvements to emission reductions relates to the distribution of abatement efforts among sectors, which depends on the relative responsiveness of each sector to the carbon price. The heterogeneity of sectoral responsiveness to carbon prices is illustrated by looking at the effect of energy efficiency on emissions from productive sectors and household energy use, as shown in Fig. 3. This points to a change in the structure of economic output. The industry and composite sectors decarbonise faster in the high energy efficiency scenario, despite higher demand for industrial and composite goods in most regions (Appendix C.1), as emissions per unit of production in both sectors decrease faster in all regions in the high energy efficiency case. Emissions do not stabilize at the same level at the end of the period. This is due to different assumptions on the final level of the energy efficiency of the leader region  and different evolutions of the energy price index. The slight increase of industrial and composite emissions after 2080 is explained by the decrease in carbon prices in both scenarios following the complete decarbonisation of electricity production (Appendix C.2). In the low energy efficiency case, the peak in carbon prices after 2080 even commands negative emissions in this sector with increasing production of electricity from biomass combined with carbon capture and storage. Contrary to the case of productive sectors, the transportation and residential sectors do not directly benefit from higher energy efficiency standards in this scenario setting. Lower carbon prices in the high energy efficiency case delay the decarbonisation of the residential sector, with higher final energy use and slightly slower improvements of the carbon intensity of final energy in that sector in the high energy efficiency scenario.  Higher final energy use in the residential sector is driven by higher household revenues and lower energy prices. Similarly, higher emissions from transport in the high energy efficiency case are induced by higher mobility (Appendix C.3) and higher CO2 intensity of transport, mainly driven by larger automobile use due to lower petrol prices and higher income.  In fact, the share of automobile in transport is higher in high energy efficiency scenarios, leading to a different transport structure over time. Low carbon prices also delay the decarbonisation of electricity production, both in terms of overall emissions and CO2 intensity of electricity production . Higher emissions from electricity production are due to higher coal use without CCS, despite lower electricity production (Appendix C.2). Energy efficiency improvements thus induce lower final energy consumption and emissions in all productive sectors and therefore the contribution of the transport and residential sectors to meet the emission constraint is reduced. The industry accounts for over 70% of emissions from productive sectors in the base year. The following section illustrates the mechanisms at play in this sector to understand the drivers of growth in productive sectors, and in the economy as a whole.",221.204866

In the modelled scenarios, the CO2 price is determined endogenously each year to satisfy the CO2 emission constraint. The CO2 price (Fig. 2) and climate policy costs directly relate to the shape of the emission constraint (cf. Appendix B). The CO2 price slowly increases between 2010 and 2040, followed by a steep increase between 2040 and 2070 as the bulk ofthe efforts occurs. The carbon price stabilizes in the long term as the emission constraint levels off (2070–2100). The marked dip between 2070 and 2090 results from the expansion of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage in the electricity mix, allowing for net negative emissions combined with the slowing of emission abatements imposed by the emission trajectory, see [77] for an analysis. The Kaya decomposition of emission factors (Fig. 3b) presents energy and macroeconomic determinants of CO2 emissions. Emission changes can be explained through the evolution of three variables: GDP, the final energy intensity of GDP and the carbon intensity of the final energy.  This decomposition shows a larger contribution of energy efficiency improvements in emission reductions in the high energy efficiency scenario (−126% vs. −94%), with a smaller contribution of the carbon intensity of energy (−72% vs. −91%). Besides, high energy efficiency reduces the stringency of the carbon constraint, allowing for higher GDP growth (+106% vs. +95% for GDP per capita). Under a given emission constraint, high energy efficiency lifts part of the decarbonisation effort because of lower energy needs in productive sectors. The emission constraint is therefore less stringent for other sectors, and high energy efficiency results in lower carbon prices. In parallel, lower carbon prices explain the slower decarbonisation of energy production in the high energy efficiency scenario. Energy efficiency improvements in productive sectors thus induce a lower reliance on carbon intensity improvements to meet the emission constraint.",221.226712

This paper analyses eight scenarios along three dimensions: high or low energy efficiency of the leader, slow or fast convergence towards the leader, and early or late climate action. Table 1 summarizes the eight scenarios. Section 4 carefully examines energy efficiency variants to understand the mechanisms through which energy efficiency propagates to the economy and affects climate change mitigation costs. To that end, two scenarios are analyzed: low energy efficiency with slow convergence and high energy efficiency with fast convergence, both in the late action setting. The scenarios are labelled high and low energy efficiency in 4, as they were calibrated following the AMPERE protocol. Section 5 explores the interaction between energy efficiency policies and the timing of mitigation. Section 5.1 examines the role ofthe speed ofconvergence towards the leader through the study of four scenarios (high or low energy efficiency, slow or fast convergence). Then, Section 5.2 then explores the interaction ofthe timing ofaction with energy efficiency policies, adding the four corresponding scenarios under early climate action. Early and late actions correspond to two exogenous emission trajectories with the same CO2 budget over the period 2010–2100 (cf. Appendix B). The emission trajectories used here were derived using a heuristic method satisfying the prescribed 2100 emission budget. The late action setting corresponds to the low short-term target of 37.3 GtCO2 in 2030 used in AMPERE WP2 scenarios. The early action scenario corresponds to immediate abatement to curb emissions below 2010 levels, resulting in emissions close to 30 GtCO2 in 2030.",221.18272

Some emerging economies may appear to be more energy efficient in some sectors at calibration year.  To address this issue, the energy intensity of the concerned sectors in these regions is allowed to reach higher levels than the initial energy intensity of the leader, before converging towards the leader. The energy efficiency parameters are calibrated so that EEI rates in the baseline correspond to the values prescribed in the modelling protocol, see [80]. EEI include technology improvements, fuel switching and price-driven behavioural changes [6]. EEI are assumed to be in part free, and in part to coincide with an increase in the mark-up rate of firms, linking EEI to the capital share in production costs. The free part ofEEI corresponds to 1 3 of total EEI. The increase in capital costs is estimated and set to completely offset the energy costs saved with more energy-efficient equipment (therefore translating the constraint that EEI investments should be profitable). EEI in productive sectors are not biased towards low carbon energy. The use of fossil and non-fossil energy decreases uniformly but may result in lower emissions if fossil energy dominates the energy mix. A shift from carbon intensive to low carbon energy use in these sectors may be induced by the increase in fossil energy prices, for instance due to the introduction of a carbon price. Fig. 1 outlines the economic channels through which energy efficiency lowers unitary energy consumption and impacts economic growth. EEI induce lower energy consumption per unit of output (ICunitaryener in Mtoe/USD) in each productive sector. This may result in higher or lower aggregated energy consumption (ICener), depending on the relative effect of lower unitary energy consumption and higher sectoral production (Q) due to lower prices. Lower prices can indeed increase consumption through the rebound effect. Lower overall energy consumption affects energy prices through two channels: a decrease in tax-exclusive prices due to lower energy use (ICener) and a relaxation of the required carbon tax to reach a set climate objective thanks to lower emissions. Overall, lower energy consumption results in lower tax-inclusive energy prices. As EEI are driven by the energy price index, lower energy prices may in turn counterbalance EEI. On the production side, lower unitary energy requirements (ICunitaryener) decrease production costs and prices (p), driving up demand and production (Q). 3.2.2. Substitution and structural change Substitution between energy goods (i.e. coal, oil, natural gas, electricity, refined liquid fuels) and substitution between transportation modes (i.e. road, rail, air or water) are driven by relative prices, given the explicitly modelled constraints on energy production and end-use equipment and infrastructure. These substitutions occur at the level of all end-use sectors. At the micro-level, learning-by-doing may induce substitution between technologies, which in turn induce energy substitution. Technical change may occur at the level of specific technologies through learning-by-doing processes. The cost of building energy production capacities is assumed to decrease with cumulative investment and production through learning-by-doing, using learning curves for all explicit technologies. The pace of cost reductions down the learning curve depends on initial built capacity, the learning rate and the floor cost. This approach has been used to characterise energy technologies, see Section 2.2. It is used in IMACLIM-R to model electricity and oil production technologies [77], and for demand technologies (e.g. cars). In energy production sectors, learning-by-doing in low-carbon technologies (triggered by carbon prices) may improve the carbon efficiency of energy transformation through the substitution from fossil energy to low carbon-alternatives. For those sectors using fossil fuels, carbon pricing will increase the energy price index. The substitution between energy sources depends on relative prices and relies on a logit decision function for new vintages (the sectoral energy mix being the sum of energy demands of all vintages). At the macro-level, carbon pricing policies can induce a change in the structure of demand both at the household and firm levels. Altering energy prices may change the nature ofthe goods produced, therefore the structure of each sector and the relative weight of each sector in total economic output.",221.862552

For energy sectors, explicit resources and technologies are modelled. Technological improvements stem from learning-by-doing for technologies (learning rates are given in [77]). Endogenous technical change in non-energy productive sectors (industry, services, agriculture) is modelled through two main channels in IMACLIM-R. First, energy efficiency improvements (EEI) in productive sectors are induced by energy prices. Second, energy substitution may occur in all sectors, driven by energy prices and technology costs. Transport by private car is modelled via explicit technologies, allowing for learning-by-doing. The model tracks vintages ofthe car fleet, allowing for the representation of inertia. In other transport sectors, technical change is modelled through EEI, driven by exogenous trends (AEEI) and fuel price elasticities. The mechanism by which learning-by-researching leads to technical change is not represented in IMACLIM-R WORLD (e.g., investments in knowledge stocks). At the aggregate level, energy efficiency improvements and energy substitution may result in structural changes of economic activity. 3.2.1. Energy efficiency improvements in productive sectors Energy efficiency improvements (EEI) in IMACLIM-R are endogenous. For each productive sector, the region with the lowest final energy use per unit of production at base year is identified as the most energy efficient region, thus dividing the world into one leader region and eleven followers for each sector. The energy efficiency of the leader evolves as a function of the endogenous energy price index, given an exogenous coefficient for EEI at constant energy prices. When the energy price index increases, the coefficient for EEI increases linearly, up to an asymptote. Conversely, when the energy price index decreases, the coefficient for EEI decreases until reaching an asymptote. For each sector, the energy intensity of the followers is assumed to converge towards the performance of the leader. The speed of convergence also depends on the energy price index: when the energy price index increases, the speed of convergence increases up to an asymptotic level, and conversely when the energy price index decreases. Note that IMACLIM-R does not differentiate between technology improvements and behavioural changes as technologies are not explicit in productive sectors.  EEI affect newly installed capacities. They also result in the retrofitting of existing capacity vintages, but to a limited extent, since it implies only marginal change on technology, processes and behaviour. Such mechanisms have been observed for instance in China where energy intensity of clinker production declined in the 1980s, thanks to the development of improved vertical kilns and the retrofitting ofnon-mechanized kilns [78].",221.82432

At a given year, technologies are fixed and no substitution between inputs can occur. Input–output coefficients evolve each year according to the engineering information contained in the dynamic modules. The evolution of the production frontier over time is determined by the joint transformation of economic and technical systems. This recursive structure relies on a systematic exchange of information between an annual macroeconomic equilibrium and technology-rich dynamic modules. The static equilibrium models short-term macroeconomic interactions each year under technology, capacity and investment constraints (cf. Appendix A.1). Each yearly equilibrium is calculated assuming Leontief production functions with fixed intermediate consumption and labour inputs (these coefficients are fixed at a given date but vary over time), decreasing static returns due to increasing labour costs at high utilization rate of production capacities [69], and fixed mark-up in non-energy sectors. A representative household maximizes utility through a trade-off between consumption goods, mobility services and residential energy use, assuming fixed end-use equipment at any given year. Market clearing conditions can lead to a partial utilization of production capacities. Fixed short-term mark-up pricing is used to model imperfect markets. Following [70], our modelling framework also accounts for imperfections in labour markets by using regional wage curves which relate real wages to the unemployment rate.  Solving this equilibrium provides a yearly snapshot of the economy, i.e. a set of information about relative prices, output, physical and financial flows and profitability rates for each sector and region. Every year, dynamic modules  use the information stemming from the previous static equilibrium to assess the response of technical systems and determine investment needs for building new production capacity (cf. Appendices A.2 and A.3 for schematics and a detailed table) investment dynamics in IMACLIM-R WORLD are described in [72]. Investment demands are expressed by each sector: for energy sectors, investment demands follow a bottom-up module, while non-energy sectors express demands to fulfil an expected production to capacity ratio of 80%. Fixed shares of households' and firms' revenues are allocated to investment supply after each equilibrium. The share of these resources dedicated to investment follows an exogenous trend. Then, this fixed amount is assigned according to investment requests from each sector: energy sectors see their requests fully met because of the assumption that the bottom-up description (which is more refined than that of the other sector) already includes the specific sectoral mechanisms for investment, while other sectors receive investment in proportion of their investment demand. The bottom-up modules for energy sectors describe the competition between explicit technologies based upon their profitability. Investment demand thus reflects microeconomic mechanisms. In non-energy sectors, the adjustment of investment levels translates the relative scarcity of production capacities. Indeed, the further the sector is from the aimed 80% production to capacity ratio, the largest the expressed investment demand and the largest both the adjustment and the allocated investment to bring the production to capacity ratio closer to 80%. The possible mismatch between optimal and allocated investments can lead to the underemployment of production factors. This may result in suboptimalities in climate and energy policies, or gains if such policies correct pre-existing suboptimalities. Once investments have been allocated among sectors, dynamic modules build new capacities and send new Leontief coefficients back to the static module to determine the next equilibrium. Each year, technical choices are flexible but only modify at the margin these coefficients and labour productivities embodied in existing equipment. In other words, capacity vintages exhibit little flexibility and only investment in new capacity is fully flexible.  This putty-clay assumption is key to represent the inertia of technical systems. 3.1.2. Modelling economic growth In IMACLIM-R, the natural growth rate is given by exogenous assumptions on active population  and labour productivity.  The growth rate of labour productivity is prescribed over time for each region and sector.  The effective economic growth rate may depart from this exogenous trend. Indeed, the structure and rate of effective growth for each region are endogenously determined by: (i) the allocation of the labour force across sectors which is governed by the final demand addressed to these sectors, and (ii) the shortage or excess of productive capacities which result from past investment decisions under imperfect expectations. First, the twelve production sectors have different productivities, captured by unitary labour requirement for production. The effective labour productivity of the economy therefore depends on the allocation of the labour force among production sectors. For instance, the overall productivity of labour increases through structural change that favours the reallocation of labour towards highly productive sectors, which may accelerate realised economic growth with respect to its natural rate. Second, yearly Leontief production functions represent short term constraints imposed on production by the availability of capital. This specification captures the effect of technical inertias which affect the realised productivity of a sector, as exogenous labour productivity gains may not be transformed into actual growth if investment shortages occur.

In this section, we discuss the challenges faced when linking technical change, energy efficiency and economic growth. Long-run studies of the interaction between technical change, the economy and climate policies have been traditionally performed either by using bottom-up approaches (often in partial equilibrium) or top-down general equilibrium energy-economy models, see [55] for a review. As briefly mentioned in Section 2, stylised top-down models explore the link between technical change and macroeconomy at a very aggregate level. Top-down models usually rely on the use of production functions [56], which mimic the set of available techniques and the technical constraints on an economy [57,58] and often use constant elasticity of substitution. However, the aggregate representation of a continuous space of technologies via production functions is only theoretically justified near the equilibrium, and the use of constant elasticities of substitution may lead to incorrectly exceeding feasible technical limits in the case of large departures from the reference equilibrium [9,59], as may well be the case for ambitious climate policy. At this level of aggregation, technical change encompasses both the choice of techniques and structural change, and explicit energy technologies are usually not modelled since production functions often fail to capture specific technology or resource constraints [60]. Bottom-up models embark detailed representation of energy production technologies. Technical change is usually modelled using one or two factor learning curves for energy technologies, and can be induced by specific policies (such as a carbon price) that favour learning in low-carbon technologies. Bottom-up studies explicitly track the set of available and operated techniques and distinguish the changes in emissions and system costs due to substitution effects or technological change [61]. However, this bottom-up approach does not account for the interaction between the energy sector and economic growth. In particular, [14] points out that assessing the long term effects of induced innovation requires a general equilibrium analysis to account for the impact of demand on energy prices. Either model structure cannot be justified when assessing policies aiming at changing development styles and the structure of economic activity to stabilize the climate [62,63]. Therefore some authors have attempted to couple bottom up models to conventional macroeconomic growth models [11,64]. The hybrid Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model IMACLIM-R aims at bridging the gap between these branches of the literature and allows to capture the macroeconomic feedbacks between energy use and supply and the structure of the economy. 3.1.1. The hybrid framework IMACLIM-R is a recursive, dynamic, multi-region and multi-sector hybrid general equilibrium model ofthe world economy [65].1 Hybrid matrices [9] ensure a description of the economy in consistent money values and physical quantities [66]. It is calibrated for the year 2001 by modifying the set of balanced input–output tables provided by the GTAP-6 dataset [67] to make them fully compatible with 2001 IEA energy balances (in",221.20501

In aggregate models, input substitution is under-stood as a movement along a production function, while technical change is a ‘shift’ of the production function [27]. Technical change was first modelled through the evolution of a technical change index (Solow's residual [28], also called Total Factor Productivity) which translates a change in the quantity of output for given inputs. [29] later introduced an autonomous energy efficiency improvement coefficient (AEEI) in energy-economy models to account for historical non-price related technical change. This coefficient translates energy efficiency improvements induced by non-price signals like norms or technical standards, by behavioural change following the evolution of lifestyles, or by structural changes (e.g., an increasing share of manufactured vs. energy-intensive industrial goods) [30]. The calibration of the AEEI coefficient is difficult and has been largely criticized in the literature, e.g., [31]. Exogenous trends of energy efficiency improvements greatly influence model results, in particular in macroeconomic models where it determines emissions and economic growth. For instance, low (respectively high) AEEI values may lead to overestimating (respectively underestimating) future energy demand and climate change mitigation costs [32]. More fundamentally, ambitious climate policies could significantly alter technology and consumption patterns and are likely to change the structure of economic growth. The calibration of AEEI on past trends therefore might not remain valid over time [33]. Models with endogenous technical change have been developed to address the shortcomings of exogenous technical change [34]. These models include some or all of four key elements: capital vintages, R&D, technological learning, and the heterogeneity of energy consumption choices. Many models represent the evolution of technical systems through successive generations ofcapital [35,36]. In this setting, new technologies can only penetrate the mix of installed capacities if they coincide with new investments to satisfy demand, replace end-of-life capital or replace capital that is no longer profitable. More broadly, the development of economy-wide technical characteristics depends on specific sectoral developments, which for instance depend on the typical lifetime of capital in each sector (e.g., sectors with long capital lifetimes will usually evolve slowly even if more efficient technologies emerge). Modelling generations of capital thus allows for the representation oftechnical inertia, which depends on the speed ofcapital capacity renewal and the speed ofinnovation diffusion [37]. It also ensures that technological characteristics at the sectoral level and economy-wide technical change are consistent. Besides, capital vintages link endogenous technological change and the availability of investments. This modelling feature is particularly relevant since the inertia of technical systems determines the short and long term costs of climate mitigation [38]. Technical change induction mechanisms have been examined by [39,40] and [41]. Based on these theoretical advances, some energy-economy models associate technical change with a stock of knowledge that evolves with R&D investments, see [42] for a review. Investments in R&D can impact the shape of the production function [43], the conversion factor between CO2 emissions and economic output or energy [16], or both [44] and [45]. R&D investments are usually assumed to remain with a constant budget, and R&D investments in energy technologies occur at the expense of R&D investments in other sectors [46,47]. Ignoring such crowding-out effects for the allocation of investment in R&D between sectors might lead to underestimating climate mitigation costs [43]. Models sometimes represent positive externalities, such as spillovers, between sectors or regions for R&D and technological learning [48]. For instance, the regional aggregate production functions benefit from a stock of “global” knowledge in [44]. Energy-economy models usually represent technological learning mechanisms through experience or learning curves. Learning curves translate the evolution of the cost of a technology as a function of cumulated experience (cumulative production or installed capacity is often used as a proxy for experience). Many econometric studies have identified learning rates of explicit energy technologies, see [49–51] for reviews. Some models use also cost asymptotes to be more realistic [52,53]. Many models use technological learning to represent endogenous technical change. In some models, cumulative abatement and R&D investments jointly drive the improvements in energy productivity and the carbon intensity of energy [45]. Using global learning curves for some low carbon technologies, [54] shows the importance of positive externalities as inter-regional spillovers reduce climate mitigation costs. Note that another form of technical change derives from the sectoral and regional disaggregation of energy–economy models. Technical change at the global level, as reflected for instance in the energy and carbon intensity of the economy, depends on technical change in various sectors and regions. Economy-wide technical change therefore depends on this level of disaggregation. Technical change at the sectoral level is affected by the heterogeneity of energy consumption choices (e.g., the energy intensity of production and household energy use).",221.8904

In other words, technical change encompasses the choice of techniques (e.g., from the plough to the tractor) and structural change (e.g., industrialisation and growth of the share of services in the economy). Input substitution can be distinguished from technical change and refers to the evolution ofthe input structure to produce a unit of output, considering a fixed set of techniques. Induced technical change is the alteration of the rate and direction of technical change in response to policy [12]. Technical change can be induced by investments in Research and Development (R&D), learning-by-doing, relative price changes, technology transfers, and behavioural change, see [5]. While R&D investments may influence the rate and direction of technical change, learning-by-doing can reduce the unit cost of a particular good as a function of experience. Technical change may also occur when a change in the relative prices of factors spurs innovation directed at reducing the use of a factor which has become relatively expensive [13]. Because of the emissions they induce, energy inputs are critical for assessing of climate change mitigation policies. Empirical studies show that higher energy prices have been associated with energy efficiency improvements. For instance, [14] shows that energy prices and energy intensity of industrial production have been negatively correlated in eight energy intensive US industries over the 1970–1990 period, with two thirds of the change in energy consumption due to price-induced factor substitution and the remaining third resulting from induced innovation. [15] also identifies rising energy prices as one of the key factors of energy intensity reduction in the Chinese industrial sector between 1997 and 1999. High fossil energy prices (for instance driven by carbon pricing) may drive firms to invest in new knowledge to develop less carbon intensive processes and products [16]. A rise in energy prices may also drive households to purchase energy-efficient equipment, products and services. Energy efficiency improvements may also be driven by technology diffusion policies. For instance, basic oxygen furnaces replaced open hearth furnaces for steel production as a more efficient technology in terms of energy and other inputs in former Eastern Germany after the reunification [17,18]. The diffusion of energy efficient technologies across regions is often seen as critical to mitigate climate change. In particular, the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol has been used as a tool to facilitate the transfer of low carbon technologies towards industrializing countries [19]. Dedicated technology policies can induce the diffusion of innovations. For instance, the large diffusion of high efficiency motors in the US occurred thanks the implementation of demand-side management programmes at the initiative of many electricity utilities. Increased energy efficiency followed the development of better insulation and magnetic materials (e.g., low-carbon silicon steel plates and light aluminium alloys). Introduced to the market in the 1970s, they represented 20% of the US market in the mid-1990s. Their share was only 1% in Europe because of the lack of market transformation initiatives [20]. However, the rebound effect following energy efficiency improvements may well lead to higher emissions. In the residential sector, energy-saving technical change may indeed lead to greater energy consumption by households as a result of lower energy prices. This is the case for China, as shown by [21]. This rebound effect is the object of extensive study, see for instance [22–24]. At the aggregate level, the impact of energy efficiency on economic growth is ambiguous as well. The estimation of elasticities on past data shows that the improved conversion of energy into physical work accounts for most of the growth attributed to technological progress [25]. Technology transfers do not necessarily translate into an increase of the productivity of all factors, see for instance [26] for a review of the relationship between technological progress, energy efficiency and economic growth. Again in the case of the Chinese industrial sector, imported technology may be labour- and energy-saving but capital-using [15].",221.85849

Some econometric studies have identified energy use as a determinant and possible limiting factor of economic growth, for instance [1]. Other studies have questioned the causal relationship between energy use and economic output, see [2] for a review. The relationship between energy prices and economic growth is less controversial. Econometric analyses have shown the correlation between oil price shocks and short-term economic downturns [3]. The oil price shocks also gave rise to a vast literature focusing on the links between energy and long-term economic growth, and on the role of technical change and capital substitution to sustain growth in an economy relying heavily upon nonrenewable energy resources, see [4] for a review. At the same time, high energy prices may bias innovation towards energy efficient technologies, see [5] for a review. This bias would allow energy-saving technical change to reduce overall energy use and CO2 emissions while sustaining long-term economic growth. Energy efficiency could thus play a crucial role in addressing climate change and energy security issues [6]. Policy-makers in many countries have acted on that premise and implemented energy efficiency policies. For instance, the European Union aims at increasing energy efficiency by 20% by 2020, while China set the objective at 16% by 2015. Specific measures include mandatory energy requirements in buildings in Europe and part of the United States and light-vehicle standards in Europe, Japan and the US. Also, most industries in these countries are regulated through standards, or participate in voluntary programmes. Such energy efficiency policies usually target specific sectors at the micro-level, and their impact on overall economic growth is ambiguous. This paper sheds light on this unresolved issue and aims at answering the following questions: How do the effects of technological innovation propagate from the micro- to the macro-level and affect overall energy efficiency and economic growth? More precisely, how do the level of energy efficiency at the sectoral level and the diffusion of technological innovations impact macroeconomic indicators? How do these mechanisms affect climate change mitigation costs? How do the dynamics of technological innovation and diffusion interact with the timing of mitigation strategies? Two main strands of the economic literature focus on technical change. On the one hand, at the micro-level, the literature studies the determinants of technological innovation and diffusion (see [7] for a review in the context of environmental issues). On the other hand, at the macro-level, the literature studies the link between technical change and growth. For instance, [8] reviews the link between the environment, technical change and economic growth, with a particular focus on optimal growth pathways. [9] questions the traditional way in which models have addressed this issue and separated top-down and bottom-up modelling approaches. In that, traditional models heeded the conclusions of [10] that the evolution of the energy sector has little impact on economic growth. Following [9] and [11], we introduce a model with endogenous technical change and economic growth. This hybrid general equilibrium model IMACLIM-R offers a tool to test the links between technical change and the contents of economic growth, coupling of a top-down structure and bottom-up modules. This dynamic recursive model allows to assess the short and long term consequences of climate change mitigation policies. The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents a selected review of the empirical literature on energy-saving technical change and of traditional approaches to model the relationship between technical change and economic growth. Section 3 presents the hybrid general equilibrium model IMACLIM-R used in this analysis. A series of numerical experiments is then performed to assess the sensitivity of macroeconomic indicators to energy efficiency at the sectoral level.

The model simulation reveals that the total cost of the nonucccs&mef scenario is curbed by 52 trillion US$ compared to the 50 % nonucccs scenario (Fig. 2f). In other words, the material efficiency improvement has an economic value of 52 trillion US$ under the target of halving global GHG without depending on nuclear and CCS. It should be noted that the technological and social costs for improve material efficiency are not included in this analysis. The implication of the analysis is that if the costs for material efficiency improvement are somehow assumed at less than 52 trillion US$, the material efficiency improvement policies are worth implementing. Figure 5 shows the sectoral breakdown of additional investment required in the 50 % reduction scenarios. In the 50 % nonucccs&mef scenario, investment in the building, transport and power sectors are curbed significantly compared to the 50 % nonucccs scenario. This indicates that material efficiency improvement in the steel and cement sectors can soften the demand for drastic emission reductions in the other sectors and can reduce investment in expensive technologies in those sectors.

However, there are non-technological CO2 emission reduction measures in these sectors. IPCC (2007), for instance, shows that improvement of material efficiency can reduce CO2 emissions in the steel and cement sectors. Recycling of steel can reduce CO2 emissions significantly because the steel making process that uses scrap steel in electric furnaces consumes only 30 % - 40 % of the energy consumed when steel is made from iron ore in blast furnaces (De Beer et al. 1998). The more fundamental countermeasure is reducing the amount of steel production itself. Higashi et al. (2012) shows that global demand for steel could be reduced by 40 % as compared to the non-countermeasure case in 2050 by accelerated use of high-strength steel and improvements in material usage efficiency. The demand for cement also can be reduced. The global demand for cement is 25 % lower in the low demand-case than in the high demand-case in IEA (2009). Another countermeasure in the cement sector is material substitution, for example the addition of wastes (e.g. blast furnace slag, fly ash) and geo-polymers to clinker IPCC (2007). Reducing clinker would potentially be an important emission reduction countermeasure because the process-induced CO2 from clinker production is the main source of emissions in the cement sector, account-ing for more than a half of the total sectoral emissions (Worrell et al. 2001). Given the potential importance of material efficiency in reducing CO2 emissions, a scenario with material efficiency improvement is developed. In this scenario, the following assumptions are made.  & Assuming an accelerated use of high-strength steel and improvement in material usage efficiency, steel production is reduced by 40 % relative to the baseline scenario in 2050. & Assumin an increased rec cle rate the share of electric furnaces in steel roduction incr eases from 33 % y(2005) t,o 70 % (2050). The scrap steel used pin this scenario is 1.2 Gton in 2050. If the generation of steel scrap is assumed to be the same level as estimated in Higashi et al. (2012), the recycle rate in 2050 becomes 90 %. & Cement production is assumed to be reduced by 25 % relative to the baseline scenario in 2050. The intensity of cement production (cement production per unit of GDP) is the same level as the low demand-case in IEA (2009). & The ortion of clinker in cement is assumed to be 60 % in 2050 as a world avera e whic h is the same ratio as existing and well-used cement, such as Portland slag ceme nt, and Portland pozzolana cement (Worrell et al. 2001).",345.928183

However, a question still remains regarding the acceptability of the scenario. Opposition to nuclear power has become stronger, particularly after the nuclear accident in Japan in March 2011. A recent study by the European Commission reveals that nuclear power is the least popular energy source, with more than half of respondents opposed to nuclear installations in the EU (EC 2011). A Japanese study on public opinions shows that at least more than a half of the country’s citizens hope for a society that is not dependent on nuclear power (Energy and Environment council 2012). Public acceptance (or lack thereof) could also be a barrier to the widespread diffusion of CCS. There are different perceptions and opinions within the scientific, political, and civil society on CCS technology. For example, a study by the European Commission (EC 2011) indicated that more than 60 % of people were anxious about the safety of CO2 storage in the EU, although the response varied by country from the lowest in Finland (50 %) to the highest in Greece (84 %). Given the apparent uncertainty regarding future deployment of nuclear and CCS technologies, a scenario without dependence on these options (“50 % nonucccs scenario”) was developed. In the 50 % nonucccs scenario, we assume a phase out of nuclear energy after 2010. This ‘phase out’ is defined as no construction of new nuclear power plants beyond those already under construction (excluding planned and proposed plants). In addition, lifetime extensions are not allowed in this scenario. This policy translates into 63 GW of power generation capacity in 2050, which is only 17 % of that in 2005. In addition, deployment of CCS is not allowed in all energy sectors, in all regions, and for all combinations with fossil fuel, bioenergy and industrial uses in this scenario. Under the above-described conditions for nuclear and CCS, the technological feasibility of reducing global GHG by 50 % in 2050 is assessed. The model analysis reveals that the 50 % nonucccs scenario is technologically feasible. However, further energy-saving and carbon intensity improvement are required in this scenario. Final energy consumption is reduced by 15 % relative to the 50 % default scenario (Fig. 2c). The carbon intensity improvement is achieved by combination of electrification and renewable energy deployment. The share of electricity in final energy consumption increases to 38 %, and 90 % of electricity is produced by renewable energies in the 50 % nonucccs scenario (Fig. 2b and c). These energy-savings and carbon intensity improvement require additional investment in technologies, which leads to an increase in the total cost for achieving the emission reduction target. In the 50 % nonucccs scenario, the total cumulative cost increases by 94 trillion US$ relative to the 50 % default scenario, resulting in a total sum of 166 trillion US$ (Fig. 2f). What is the main factor behind this significant increase in the cost? Sector-wise comparison of CO2 emissions between the 50 % default and 50 % nonucccs scenarios shows an increase in emissions in the power generation, steel, and cement sectors in the 50 % nonucccs scenario (Fig. 3). In these sectors CCS is such an important technological option in reducing CO2 that the other options are not able to take over the role ofCCS for following reasons. The process of making steel from iron ore uses coal (in the form of coke) or gas as reduction agents and it is difficult to reduce CO2 emissions from that process without using CCS. Similarly, the process-induced CO2 from the clinker making process in the cement sector is difficult to reduce without using CCS. In the power generation sector, only CCS combined with bioenergy is the option that can provide net negative CO2. Thus, CCS has an indispensable role in deep cut of CO2 emissions in the steel, cement and power generation sectors, and an absence of CCS would have a large impact on these sectors. On the other hand, limitation of nuclear power has a relatively small impact, because there are other zero-emission options (e.g. renewable energies) available in the power generation sector; indeed, decrement of nuclear energy is covered by increment of renewable energies in the 50 % nonucccs scenario (Fig. 2b). The increased emissions in the steel, cement and power sectors translate into a growing need for emission reductions in the other sectors, especially in the building and transport sectors (Fig. 3). The additional emission reductions in these sectors are achieved by mainly two types of measures, that is, energy savings and electrification. The CO2 emissions in the building sector are reduced by further introduction of high-efficiency building insulation and electrification of space heating.  Over 85 % of the space heating service is supplied by high-efficiency heat pump air conditioners in combination with efficient insulations systems in the 50 % nonucccs scenario. The passenger transport sector achieves significant CO2 emissions reductions by widespread use of electric vehicles; it accounts for 65 % of the passenger transport service (Fig. 4). Thus, electrification and energy efficiency improvement in the building and transport sectors are crucially important for feasibility of the 50 % nonucccs scenario. The above-mentioned energy-saving and electrification technologies in the building and transport sectors are relatively expensive. The increased expense to those technologies is one ofthe main factors that make the total cost ofthe 50 % nonucccs scenario very high (Fig. 5).",346.924974

On the other hand, the second measure, carbon intensity, is greatly improved by fuel switching in the 50 % default scenario. In this scenario the share of fossil fuels in primary energy consumption is reduced to 46 % in 2050. In other words, more than a halfofthe primary energy is provided by zero (or net negative) emission sources. These include bioenergy technologies in combination with CCS, which results in net negative emissions when used in a sustainable way. The renewable energies, such as hydro, biomass, solar and wind, account for 70 % of power generation, collectively (Fig. 2b). Together with nuclear energy, zero (or net negative) emission energies account for 80 % ofpower generation. The rest (20 %) is supplied by gas power plants, half of which are equipped with CCS. CCS, the third type of CO2 emission reduction, plays a big role. The amount of CO2 captured in the 50 % default scenario is about 10 GtCO2 in 2050 (Fig. 2e). This means that 45 % of the total amount of CO2 generated from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes is captured using CCS technology. CCS is used in steel (1.0 GtCO2), cement (1.5 GtCO2), power generation (5.1 GtCO2) and other transformation sectors (2.2 GtCO2) in 2050. The cumulative additional cost (i.e. the sum of investment, operation, and maintenance costs of technologies and energy cost addition to baseline scenario. Carbon prices are not included.)

The regional emissions denote domestic emissions in each region under the globally uniform carbon price, and do not include carbon credit, which is traded internationally. The GHG emissions in 2050 in the 50 % default scenario range from 14 % to 65 % of the baseline emissions. The variance of the reduction rate among regions stems from regional potential of emission reduction, which is influenced by baseline emission, energy price, availability of resources, industrial structure, characteristics of energy systems, etc. Japan, for example, has a low rate of emission reduction because of relatively small amount of renewable energy resources and CCS capacity. Note that emission reduction projected in this study represents emission reduction potentials under the globally uniform carbon price, and does not directly link to regional emission target.",346.131682

The primary energy consumption grows at a similar rate as CO2 emissions during the same period (Fig. 2). This means increase of CO2 emissions is mainly attributed to the growing amount of energy consumption and not to carbon intensity of energy. The final energy consumption increases at about the same rate as primary energy consumption. The share of electricity in final energy consumption increases over time as electrification (shift from fossil fuel or traditional biomass to electricity) progresses in end-use sectors, mainly in developing countries. This trend makes electricity consumption increase at a rapid rate, reaching 2.5 times the 2005 level. Regarding power generation, fossil fuels remain the dominant energy sources with their share increasing from 66 % in 2005 to 77 % in 2050. Nuclear power has a decreasing share as capacity expansion is slower compared to gas and coal power plants. The role of renewable energies such as solar, wind and biomass is relatively small because there is little incentive to invest in such energies in the absence of a climate policy.

It simulates energy consumption and GHG emissions (e.g., CO2, CH4, N2O, HFC, PFC and SF6) with a detailed framework for technology selection. The detailed description of technologies is a major feature of the model (See Electronic Supplemental Material for a full list of technologies used in the model). The technology selection is formulated by linear programming algorithms that minimize the total system cost (including the initial investment, operation, and maintenance costs of technologies, energy cost, and other costs such as carbon tax) given fixed service demands (e.g. steel production, passenger transport, space heating demand).

The stabilization of temperature at this low level requires a significant reduction of GHG emissions in the first half of 21st century as well as in the latter half of the century (Rogelj et al. 2011). IPCC (2007), for example, show that limiting the increase in the global mean temperature to less than 2.4° above the pre-industrial level, using a best estimate of climate sensitivity, requires reductions in CO2 emissions of 50 %–85 % in 2050 relative to the 2000 level. On the other hand, there is uncertainty regarding future deployment of large-scale low-carbon technologies. Since the Fukushima accident in March 2011 there has been increasing skepticism among citizens about the safety of nuclear energy, and some countries (e.g. Germany, Switzerland) have decided to phase-out their existing nuclear power plants. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is another large-scale technology associated with uncertainty of various environmental impacts (IPCC 2005). Although there are high expectations for the role of CCS in reducing CO2 emissions (see for example Akashi and Hanaoka 2012), there are still uncertainties surrounding its technological reliability and social acceptability. Given the uncertainty regarding the future deployment of nuclear and CCS, it is important to assess the impacts of the unavailability of these technologies on climate policy. A number of studies have explored an implication of lack of technologies in climate policy scenario. Okagawa et al. (2012), for example, have investigated economic impact of absence of nuclear and CCS on climate policy by using computable general equilibrium model. Krey and Riahi (2009) have assessed implication of technology failure for feasibility, costs and likelihood of achieving climate target by using energy system model. However, a detailed technological assessment on implication of lack of technologies in climate policy scenario has yet been conducted. This paper highlights the findings of scenario analyses conducted using the AIM/Enduse[Global] model as part of EMF 27 (see Kriegler et al. in this special issue). The main goal is to investigate the technological feasibility and economic viability ofa climate policy that does not depend on nuclear and CCS in a mid-term perspective (until 2050). In particular, it focuses on the radiative forcing target of 2.6 W/m2, which roughly corresponds to the climate goal oflimiting increase in the global average temperature below 2 °C above pre-industrial level.",345.9046

Given the apparent uncertainty surrounding the future deployment of nuclear and CCS technologies, we intensively investigated emission reduction scenarios without nuclear and CCS. The analysis using AIM/Enduse[Global] shows the emission reduction target is technologically feasible, but the cost for achieving the target becomes very high if nuclear and CCS options are limited. The main reason for the cost rise is that additional investment for expensive technologies is required in order to compensate for emission increases in the steel, cement and power generation sectors in the absence of CCS. On the other hand, if material efficiency improvement measures, such as material substitution, efficient use of materials and recycling, are taken, the cost of achieving the emission reduction target is significantly reduced. The result indicates the potentially important role of material efficiency improvement in curbing the cost of significant GHG emission reductions without depending on nuclear and CCS.",346.91731

While we examined many implications of these land policies, some effects are missing from our assessment, including the impact on ecosystem services, the effect on water demand, and the cost of implementation. Cases with significant deforestation are likely to lead to large losses in ecosystem services, and scenarios with large deployments of bioenergy may require more water for irrigation. All of these effects will vary significantly across land policy scenarios. Policy implementation would also bring new challenges. For example, implementing the terrestrial emissions pricing in the UCT scenarios would require the transfer of large sums of money to or from landowners when they increase or decrease their carbon stocks. This requires (1) the identification of landowners, (2) the monitoring of carbon stocks, and (3) the transfer of potentially large amounts of money. Similarly, the protected land cases also introduce issues of monitoring and enforcement. These policies also require a high degree of coordination across regions, time, and activities. The results discussed here are sensitive to assumptions made in the model, particularly those related to intensification, the elasticity of demand, and the means of implementing policies. Although we have assumed continued increases in crop yields over time in all scenarios, GCAM does not include price-induced intensification within a given region or time period. Including more intensification options could reduce the land-use change, the resulting LUC CO2 emissions, and the increase in food prices. However, the method by which the intensification is achieved has implications for other results. For example, increased use of fertilizer would lead to lower LUC CO2 emissions, but increased agricultural N2O emissions.. Next, allowing food demand to adjust more in response to price changes would dampen the changes in food prices and the expansion of cropland observed in the scenario results. Finally, the means of implementing the policies in GCAM strongly influences the results. For example, in the 50 % Forest scenario, we protected 50 % of forests in each region. If we protected 50 % of forest globally instead and allowed economics to determine which forests to keep, we may observe less LUC change, higher global average food yields, and lower food prices. In summary, the various land policies consider differ in their costs and benefits. No policy is clearly preferable under all metrics considered. For example, the policy with the lowest cost of mitigation, the UCT, has large increases in food prices. The policy with the lowest food prices, the Bio Emiss Tax, has the highest electricity prices. Instead, the choice in land policy requires one to make tradeoffs between energy services, food prices, land-use change, and the cost of mitigation.",346.925766

We find that the policies we examined have differing effects on the different segments of the economy (see Table 2). Absent any land policy (FFICT) widespread deforestation occurs to accommodate the production of bioenergy. This renders the terrestrial system as a significant source of emissions. As a result, significant emissions mitigation is required by the energy system, driving up the carbon price in the near-term. However, the effect on food prices is minimal, as the clearing of forests leaves sufficient land to accommodate both food and bioenergy production. Policies that incentivize afforestation (UCT) result in increased forest cover and significant terrestrial mitigation, a result consistent with previous work (Strengers et al. 2008; Wise et al. 2009). The UCT policies are more economically efficient in that they include terrestrial carbon as part of the policy. As a result, they require less stringent emissions reductions from the energy system, resulting in a lower carbon price, particularly in the near-term. However, these policies result in forests competing for land with food, driving up food prices. Policies aimed at reducing deforestation by prescribing limits on land use change (99 % Land, 99 % Forest, 50 % Forest) are only effective at maintaining forest cover when significant portions of the landscape are protected. Although these policies do not provide any incentive for expansion of forest, they do limit the amount of clearing of forest for bioenergy, which unchecked could lead to widespread deforestation. In these cases, emissions mitigation from the energy system is in the middle of the range of scenarios studied here, and thus, so is the price of carbon. However, the 99 % Land scenario puts significant pressure on the agriculture system, driving up the price of food. Policies that limit bioenergy consumption, either through an explicit constraint (Bio 100) or a penalty (Bio Emiss Tax) can limit deforestation, but only if the penalty is sufficiently high or the constraint sufficiently low. Without restrictions on the use of land or pressures to afforest, the effect on food prices in these scenarios is minimal. However, these policies never result in afforestation, and thus, all emissions mitigation occurs in the energy system. This emissions mitigation has to be achieved with limited bioenergy, increasing the carbon price. The combination of high carbon prices and limited bioenergy result in higher prices of final energy carriers, and thus, price-induced energy conservation. Another result that becomes clear in the Bio Emiss Tax scenarios is that the direct impact of imposition of a penalty on bioenergy is a reduction in its use. The penalty itself, though it may be intended as a proxy for including land use change emissions from bioenergy into the policy, does not provide any incentive to use bioenergy resources like residue products that have lower carbon emissions or to grow bioenergy crops in places where the terrestrial carbon impact is low. Instead, the penalty is a blunt instrument that limits terrestrial emissions by simply driving out bioenergy production.",345.952964

These differences interact to influence the cost of mitigation in interesting ways. In this section, we begin with a discussion of the carbon price required to reach the climate target. One observed result is that land policy will impact carbon prices (Fig. 5a) both by changing the amount ofmitigation required by the energy system and by changing the potential supply of bioenergy available for mitigation. Scenarios that do not protect or efficiently incorporate land use require more mitigation by the energy system, which tends to result in higher carbon prices. Scenarios with less bioenergy available also tend to have higher carbon prices. Thus, the scenario with the highest carbon price is the Bio Emiss Tax scenario, where the energy system does all of the emissions mitigation and bioenergy is priced out of the energy system. The scenario with the lowest carbon price for the first half of the century is the UCT scenario, which has a great deal of terrestrial emissions mitigation, yet still uses a fair amount of bioenergy. This lower carbon price should be expected since, in the UCT, the use of land and bioenergy is done in a manner that is economically more efficient with respect to total carbon emissions from the terrestrial and energy systems. Another measure of the cost of mitigation is the area under the marginal abatement cost curve, a measure of the deadweight loss of the policy (Calvin et al. 2009). Under this metric, annual costs (Fig. 5b, Table 2) generally exhibit the same ranking as the carbon price. The cumulative discounted cost of mitigation, however, is lowest in the UCT ($10 trillion 2005$) and highest in the FFICT ($21 trillion 2005$) and Bio Emiss Tax ($24 trillion 2005$) cases. This ranking is to be expected, policies that perfectly price the externality (UCT) are less costly than those that neglect some portion of the economy from the policy. Interestingly, some policies reach similar cost levels for different reasons. For example, the FFICT and Bio Emiss Tax case both have cumulative costs around $20 trillion 2005$, but the FFICT has higher near-term costs and lower long-term costs than the Bio Emiss Tax case due to differing terrestrial carbon emissions in the near-term and bioenergy availability in the long-run.",345.816602

Since we have imposed a hard limit on total radiative forcing, increases in emissions in one sector of the economy must be compensated by other sectors of the economy, changing the balance between energy system and land-use emissions (Fig. 4, Table 2). Consistent with previous findings, scenarios with large-scale deployment of bioenergy (e.g., FFICT, 50 % Forest) have higher land-use change emissions and lower fossil fuel and industrial emissions than scenarios with limits to bioenergy (e.g., Bio 100, Bio Emiss Tax). These scenarios rely heavily on bioenergy in combination with CO2 capture and storage (BECCS) to reduce emissions, capturing as much as 166 GtCO2 over the century in the FFICT from BECCS alone. Scenarios with strong policies to reduce deforestation (e.g., 99 % Land, 99 % Forest) result in a net-neutral terrestrial system, that is, land-use change emissions are virtually zero. This results in higher allowable energy-system emissions, as the energy system does not need to compensate for the terrestrial system. The scenario with afforestation policies (e.g., UCT) results in negative terrestrial system emissions, and thus has the highest allowable energy system emissions. Land policy also affects the balance between CO2 emissions and other greenhouse gases (Figure S8) and between greenhouse gases (GHG) and other substances. Scenarios with lower meat consumption (e.g., UCT and 99 % Land) have lower CH4 emissions. Scenarios with higher bioenergy production (e.g., FFICT) have higher N2O emissions (Table 2). These increases must be compensated by either reductions in CO2 emissions or by changes in radiative forcing from non-GHG substances. The change in GHG emissions across scenarios, however, is small, with the highest GHG emissions scenario only having 5 % more emissions cumulatively than the low emissions scenario. As shown in Fig. 5, emissions for many of the scenarios change abruptly in the middle of the century. This kink in emissions occurs when the radiative forcing target is first reached. Emissions after that point in time are dictated by the climate system and must adjust to ensure that radiative forcing does not exceed 3.7 W/m2.",346.918253

First, the imposition of a land policy affects the amount of emissions produced by the agriculture and land system (discussed below). Second, the policies we are considering have a significant effect on the amount of bioenergy supplied (Figs. 1 and S3). This forces the energy system to rely on other, perhaps more expensive, energy technology options. To illustrate this point, we examine the electricity generation mix (Fig. 3) and refined liquids production (Figure S7) in the year 2050. In both sectors, we observe that cases with more land restrictions, and thus, less bioenergy consumption, result in a heavier reliance on other power generation options (e.g., nuclear and fossil fuels with CCS) and on other liquid fuels (e.g., crude oil). Because the electric sector has several carbon-free options in addition to bioenergy, we do not observe declines in electricity generation due to limited bioenergy. In fact, the opposite effect occurs: electricity generation increases in the Bio Emiss Tax case to compensate for reductions in other final energy carriers which have more limited non-bioenergy low carbon options. For example, we observe an increase in electric vehicles in this scenario. However, the reduction in refined liquids is only partially compensated for by an increase in electricity. Restrictions on bioenergy, as in the Bio Emiss Tax and Bio 100 cases, result in higher prices of final energy carriers. For example, the cost of electricity generation in the United States in 2050 is 25 % higher in the Bio Emiss Tax case than in the Reference, and 21 % higher in the Bio 100 case than the Reference (Table 2). These increases in prices lead to reductions in energy use, as consumers reduce their demand for energy services due to the increased cost. Similar price differences would occur for other regions and larger price differences would occur for other fuel carriers.",346.91443

In the protected land cases, the portion of land being protected is effectively assigned an infinite value, which prevents expansion into these lands even under when bioenergy is desirable. However, the protected land scenarios only impact a prescribed percentage of existing non-commercial forest or other land, while the UCT scenario increases the value of potentially forested land (i.e., land that is not forested today but could sustain forests in the future) as well. As a result, the UCT scenario is the only case that provides incentives for afforestation, and thus, is the only scenario that results in a non-negligible net increase in global forested land.  The increase in forests is the result of an active afforestation program and we assume that the trees planted in each region are representative of the forests that already exist in that region (e.g., if a region currently has Aspen forests, then we assume more Aspen trees are planted). Existing forests are not cleared to accommodate this afforestation program. When the comprehensive policies are not imposed, the reduction in forested land is significant. For example, the FFICT results in 15 % of the world’s forests cleared by mid-century. Protecting 50 % of forestland, as in the Forest 50 % scenario, reduces deforestation to 6 %. Increasing the level of forest protection will result in lower levels of deforestation. Limiting bioenergy consumption to 100 EJ/yr reduces deforestation to 2 %. Allowing more bioenergy could result in more deforestation; however, the exact amount depends on the particular bioenergy feedstock and the location in which it is grown. Some increases in bioenergy (e.g., through increased residues or dedicated bioenergy on abandoned cropland) could occur without any affect on forest cover. Similarly, taxing bioenergy emissions results in only 2 % deforestation, with slightly more declines in forest mid-century to accommodate increases in 1st generation bioenergy. The increased incentives for afforestation in the UCT case, the constraints on deforestation in the protected land cases result in different levels of competition for land uses among forests, bioenergy, and food. Food demand in GCAM has no or low price elasticity,  and thus, we observe larger changes in the price of food (Fig. 2b, Table 2) than in total food production as competition for land rises. Food prices are highest when other demands for land are greatest. Thus, the cases with more land included in the policy (e.g., UCT and 99 % Land) have the highest food prices. While both of these cases include all non-commercial land in the policy, the 99 % Land case is more rigid than the UCT, forbidding expansion into these ecosystems. As a result, its price is higher than the UCT. Cases where bioenergy provides the only increased competition for land result in only modest increases in food prices, suggesting that the amount of arable land in the world is sufficiently large to accommodate both food and these levels of bioenergy production, carbon implications notwithstanding. The increases in food prices in the UCT and 99 % Land scenarios are substantial, and thus we observe a decline in global beef consumption even with our low demand elasticity (Figure S6).",346.92543

Different policies result in different levels of bioenergy use, both total and by feedstock (Figs. 1 and S5).4 Scenarios where bioenergy is not penalized and terrestrial carbon is not valued (e.g., the FFICT) tend to have higher bioenergy demand than scenarios where bioenergy is penalized (e.g., Bio Emiss Tax) or constrained (e.g., Bio 100). Scenarios that provide incentives for other land types, like non-commercial forests, (e.g., UCT) have lower bioenergy demand, because of these forests compete with bioenergy for land. Instead, forest cover increases, sometimes substantially (Fig. 2a). Similarly, the 99 % Land case has less bioenergy, as all of it must be grown on non-protected lands (i.e., existing cropland). The difference in bioenergy across scenarios is largely due to differences in the amount of2nd generation bioenergy, a land-based feedstock. However, in the Bio 100 scenario, all types of bioenergy are reduced as all contribute to the constraint.

All of these scenarios are based on the reference scenario described in (Thomson et al. 2011). In this reference scenario, global population peaks at 9.2 billion in 2070 before declining. Gross world product grows eight-fold between 2005 and 2095 (Figure S1A). Thus, the reference scenario falls in the middle of the range of population and GDP scenarios examined by the IPCC (see Fisher et al. 2007). Reference scenario primary energy consumption nearly triples over the course ofthe century and continues to be dominated by fossil fuels (Figure S1B). As a result, fossil fuel and industrial CO2 emissions grow from ~30GtCO2/yr in 2005 to ~80GtCO2/yr in 2095 (Figure S1D). Reference scenario global cropland increases by almost 10 % by mid-century before declining again, due to declines in global population and increases in agricultural productivity (Figure S1C). Forest cover declines by approximately 3 % between 2005 and 2095. Land-use change CO2 emissions remain positive until 2070 (Figure S1D). Table 1 defines the scenarios discussed in this paper. The climate policy scenarios fall into five categories: emissions price scenarios, protected land scenarios, bioenergy constraint scenarios, bioenergy emissions tax scenarios, and no land policy. In each case, we achieve the climate policy target through the imposition of a carbon price on the energy system.  This price is chosen to minimize the cost of mitigation (see Calvin et al. 2009). As a result, the price will rise at the interest rate until the target (3.7 W/m2) is reached. After the target is reached, the price adjusts to maintain the target and can fluctuate significantly. The emissions price scenarios apply a universal carbon tax (UCT) to both the energy system and the terrestrial system. In addition to penalizing terrestrial carbon emissions, this policy creates incentives to increase terrestrial carbon stocks. In the UCT scenario, we apply a carbon price to the terrestrial system that is equal to that of the energy system.  The UCT scenario is the only policy considered with an incentive for afforestation. The protected land scenarios set aside different amounts of forest and other ecosystems. These areas are removed from economic competition, preventing their use for agriculture or timber production, and thus are preserved throughout the century. The bioenergy constraint scenarios simply limit global bioenergy consumption to 100 EJ per year. The bioenergy emissions tax scenario applies a monetary penalty to bioenergy when consumed in the energy system to account for the potential LUC emissions resulting from its production. For this scenario, we examine a single carbon penalty of 0.027 tonnes C per GJ. This value, equivalent to the amount of carbon in coal, is selected to represent a case where all carbon benefits of using bioenergy instead of coal in the energy system are offset by the resulting LUC emissions.",345.92356

GCAM (Calvin et al. 2011) is a global integrated assessment model linking together representations of the economy, energy system, agriculture system, land cover, and climate. GCAM divides the world into 14 geopolitical regions in the energy and economic systems. GCAM computes supply, demand, and prices from 2005 to 2095 in 5-year intervals for a variety of primary energy carriers, secondary energy carriers, and agricultural and forest products. The supplies of agricultural and forest products are GCAM determined in GCAM’s agriculture and land use model (Wise and Calvin 2011). For agriculture and land-use, GCAM divides the world is divided into 151 regions, combining the 14 geopolitical regions with as many as 18 agro-ecological zones (AEZs) in each (Monfreda et al. 2009). Land allocation decisions in the model are determined based on expected profitability among competing uses. The supply of each agricultural product is determined by exogenously specified yields and the amount of land allocated to that particular use. GCAM includes several different commercial and non-commercial land uses including eleven crop categories, six animal categories, five bioenergy crops, forests, pasture, grassland, shrubs, desert, tundra, and urban land. GCAM includes several types of bioenergy, including dedicated bioenergy crops, crop residues, municipal solid waste, and traditional bioenergy. Bioenergy serves as a linking mechanism between the energy and agriculture/land-use systems, where demand is determined by the energy system and supply is determined by the agriculture/land-use system. GCAM includes several different dedicated bioenergy feedstocks (e.g., switchgrass, miscanthus, willow, jatropha, and eucalyptus), with region-dependent availability and yields. Yields for each of these crops, and all crops, are assumed to improve over time. These improvement rates vary by region, with higher improvement rates in developing regions (Kyle et al. 2011). GCAM tracks all direct and indirect emissions arising from the use of bioenergy and land-use decisions. This is important because indirect land-use change emissions can be far larger than the direct emissions. For all land types and uses, GCAM models the temporal accumulation of terrestrial carbon and associated carbon emissions from land-use change based on carbon growth and decay profiles specific to each land use in each subregion (Kyle et al. 2011). GCAM also includes emissions ofN2O and CH4 from agricultural production, including N2O from crop and bioenergy production, and CH4 from livestock and rice production. These emissions increase as the underlying activities increase (e.g., increases in bioenergy production will result in increased N2O), but can be reduced in some sectors in response to climate policy. More information on the GCAM model is available at http://wiki.umd.edu/gcam. All land use and land cover, including the non-commercial lands, are fully integrated into the economic modeling in GCAM, rather than linked externally in a one-way downscaling or post-processing routine. As a result, policies that protect certain land categories or value terrestrial carbon in non-commercial land can be modeled. This coverage gives GCAM the capability to model policies that jointly cover carbon in all activities in the energy, agriculture, forest, and other land uses.",347.077035

The employment of bioenergy with CO2 capture and storage (CCS) has been shown to hold enormous potential for achieving deep global emissions reductions and potentially negative global carbon emissions. But, bioenergy exhibits a large terrestrial footprint if it expands to the scale of hundreds of exajoules (EJ) per year (Edmonds et al. 2003; Gurgel et al. 2007; Wise et al. 2009; Chum et al. 2011; Reilly et al. 2012). The resulting competition for land has been shown to cause the loss of natural ecosystems and produce large ancillary land-use change (LUC) emissions associated unless appropriate land-use policies are engaged (Edmonds et al. 2003; Gurgel et al. 2007; Fargione et al. 2008; Searchinger et al. 2008; Schmer et al. 2008; Gillingham et al. 2008; Mellilo et al. 2009; Wise et al. 2009; Reilly et al. 2012; Popp et al. 2012). Policies have been proposed to address these issues, by incorporating land management into mitigation strategies. For example, in 2007 the Bali Conference of the Parties to the Framework Convention on Climate Change ((UN 1992), COP13) established a program for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD; United Nations 2008, 2012). This program aims, among other things, to reduce LUC emissions by protecting forested areas. Policies have also been proposed that have direct implications for bioenergy consumption. Favorable tax treatment, for example the United States tax credit program, has been employed to accelerate deployment of bioenergy use. However, policies could also be used to reduce the rate of expansion and to account for indirect LUC emissions by treating bioenergy as if it were a quasi-fossil fuel—directly associating the LUC emissions with bioenergy production and use. For example, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency released a “Tailoring” rule in 2010 (EPA 2010). This rule treats emissions from bioenergy-fired boilers in the same manner as fossil emissions. Recent work has begun to analyze the implications of these policies. Strengers et al. (2008) explored the potential and costs of afforestation for carbon plantations on abandoned cropland using a global model that considered the integrated demand for land for food and bioenergy over the century. Using a more generalized approach, Wise et al. (2009) showed that if all (fossil fuel, industrial and land-use change) carbon emissions are valued equally that the potential of bioenergy could be realized, the loss of natural ecosystems and forests reduced, and these ecosystems and forests could actually be expanded. The paper also showed that treating bioenergy as a carbon-neutral energy carrier without also applying carbon values to LUC emissions could result in dramatic loss in ecosystems and large pulses of LUC emissions.  Reilly et al. (2012) examined the same two policy architectures and found the same qualitative result; however, the difference in LUC emissions between the two scenarios was significantly smaller. These two policies—valuing all carbon emissions equally and only valuing fossil fuel and industrial carbon emissions—may be unrealistic, but serve as useful benchmarks. Here, we expand on the work of Strengers et al. (2008), Wise et al. (2009) and Reilly et al. (2012) by exploring a broad range of land policies, carefully considering the trade-offs of each policy. We consider a single long-term, global policy objective, limiting radiative forcing to 3.7 watts per meter squared (W/m2) in the year 2095. We then test the implications for land use, energy, emissions, and costs of meeting that goal, using five alternative bioenergy and land-use policy architectures: 1. Emissions prices: a price applied to LUC emissions equal to the price applied to fossil fuel and industrial emissions, and bioenergy treated as a carbon-neutral energy form, 2. Protected lands: policies to limit human use of forests and/or other ecosystems, and bioenergy treated as a carbon-neutral energy form, 3. Bioenergy constraints: limits on the maximum amount of bioenergy that can be consumed, and bioenergy treated as a carbon-neutral energy form, 4. Bioenergy emissions tax: bioenergy is penalized for its potential LUC emissions, by applying a price to a fixed assignment of “effective” carbon emissions, and no other limits on land use, and 5. No penalty for LUC emissions, no protections for forests or other ecosystems, and bioenergy treated as a carbon-neutral energy form.",346.91631

These scenarios are illustrative in nature, and designed to explore trade-offs. We find that the policies we examined have differing effects on the different segments of the economy. Comprehensive land policies can reduce land-use change emissions, increasing allowable emissions in the energy system, but have implications for the cost of food. Bioenergy penalties and constraints, on the other hand, have little effect on food prices, but result in less bioenergy and thus can increase mitigation costs and energy prices.",346.924824

These measures are assumed to increase towards the maximum abatement in the year 2050 and to remain at this level up to 2100. In 2030, halfofthe maximum reduction is achieved, going beyond the standard settings in IMAGE. It is estimated that with current techniques, relative emission reductions in the oil and gas industry can reach up to 95%50,51.

The lifestyle scenario explores the possibility that environmentally friendly and resource-efficient lifestyles are adopted by a majority ofthe population worldwide. The scenario includes dietary change, food waste reduction and changes in transportation and residential energy use. For dietary change, we assume a quick transition to a healthier diet (the so-called Wilett diet) between 2020 and 2050, with low levels ofmeat consumption: 10.4kcalories per capita per day ofcattle, 16.0 ofpork, 32.3 ofeggs, 33.2 ofpoultry and 13.0 offish and seafood . The reduced consumption ofmeat proteins is compensated by increasing pulses/oilcrops (mostly soy) and adjusting staples/luxuries to keep the total calories as in the default scenario. Earlier implementations ofthis scenario have been described in detail . Food waste as a fraction oftotal demand is reduced in households (10% less avoidable waste per year starting in 2011, reaching 98% reduction in 2050), and in storage and distribution systems (5% less waste per year starting in 2011, reaching 86% in 2050) (for details, see ref. ). For transport, changes are made to reduce transport volume and the use ofenergy-intensive modes. The new parameterization leads to less private vehicle use through increased car sharing and more mass transit options and non-motorized options (walking, cycling). Secondly, it leads to reducing air travel demand (for details, see refs ). For residential energy use, changes are made in heating and cooling demand, and appliance ownership and use. For heating and cooling, the base temperature has been adapted by 1°C downward and 1°C upward, respectively . Water heating demand is reduced by assuming reduced shower time of25%. Household electricity demand is curtailed by reducing the ownership ofappliances to a maximum oftwo per household. This does not affect appliance ownership in households that have not yet satiated basic energy function demands. Tumble dryers, however, are assumed to be completely phased out. We also assume environmentally conscious behaviour in domestic appliance use (reducing standby and smarter use ofappliances).

The additional reduction measured (see Supplementary Information, Table 1) means that the alternative scenarios originally overachieved the 1.9Wm− target; however, an additional ‘BECCS price’ was introduced to explore how the overachievement could be used to reduce the use ofBECCS.

In the analysis presented here, the integrated assessment model IMAGE  is used to explore alternative pathways leading mostly to a radiative forcing level of1.9Wm− in 2100. The scenarios are based on different assumptions that could minimize the use ofCO2 removal (CDR). The scenarios are all derived from the IMAGE implementation ofthe SSP2 scenario . The SSP2 scenario describes a future with middle-of-the-road assumptions for input parameters, making it a relevant starting point for the analysis. Two default mitigation scenarios are based on the standard set-up ofthe model, and implemented via the introduction ofa uniform global carbon price to meet the radiative forcing target . The alternative scenarios are developed by implementing narrative-based changes to the input assumptions, mostly in the 2020–2050 period (see Table 1 and Supplementary Information). We evaluate first the ‘pure’ impact ofthe measures under baseline conditions. Subsequently, their impact on the use ofenergy-based CDR in deep mitigation scenarios is examined. This is achieved by developing a mitigation scenario with the same carbon price trajectory as used as in the default 1.9Wm− scenario (DEF_1.9) but applying a ‘cost premium’ on BECCS to reduce its use to a level consistent with the 1.9 Wm− target. Since it is nearly impossible to put a price tag on most ofthese measures, none ofthe scenarios has been evaluated in terms ofcosts. We finally combine the different options to explore the question ofwhat would be needed to totally avoid the use ofBECCS in IMAGE. Below we describe the IMAGE model and the scenario implementation ofthe baseline, the alternative assumptions and the reduced CDR scenarios. Description of key scenario assumptions. SSP2-baseline scenario. The analysis has been performed on the basis ofthe SSP2 scenario as implemented in IMAGE . In the SSP2 scenario, which forms part ofthe overall SSP set, middle-of-the-road assumptions have been made for all key model assumptions. This includes demographic assumptions (global population increases to around 9 billion people in 2050 and stabilizes after that), economic growth, technology change and lifestyle. The changes in agriculture and the energy system in the short term are similar to projections by the Food and Agriculture Organization ofthe United Nations and the International Energy Agency . The IMAGE implementation ofthe SSP2 scenario leads to trends that are similar to those ofthe SSP2 marker for overall energy production, land use and radiative forcing, but represents particular characteristics ofthe IMAGE model . The default response scenario described in this paper leading to the 2.6Wm− target is very similar to the climate policy scenarios described elsewhere (except for small updates in emission factors)19.",509.2439

We have demonstrated that implementing a more empirically consistent technology diffusion formulation than the crude, exogenous constraints typically featured in energy system optimization models is feasible, is not overly complicated, and has important implications for the market adoption of low-carbon electricity technologies. It is our hope that developers ofIAMs used for technology assessments and policy evaluations will target technology diffusion constraints as an area for model improvement. Our endogenous diffusion formulations incorporate capacity expansion constraints based on accumulating and depreciating knowledge stocks, spatial technology diffusion from core to rim via knowledge spillovers, and spillovers across closely related technologies. These are all features that characterize historical energy transitions but are neglected by the exogenous diffusion constraints imposed in traditional energy system optimization model formulations. Four major insights emerge from our results. First, energy system optimization models with exogenous diffusion constraints may overstate the ability of nascent technologies to quickly penetrate markets and replace more mature technologies. This has been suspected previously (Bertram et al., 2015), and our results support this concern. The exogenous constraints do not respect the empirically observed lock-in phenomenon, whereby mature technologies have an advantage based not only on cost, but also on existing infrastructures and a sufficiently large and experienced capacity installation industry. Second, new technologies which are attractive options in developing regions but not in advanced regions may struggle to diffuse if those developing regions lack the resources or institutions required to pioneer their development and commercialization. Biomass CCS is one such technology, but its diffusion could proceed if experience gained from deployment of other CCS-coupled generation options (e.g., gas CCS) facilitates biomass CCS adoption. This insight suggests that understanding cross-technology knowledge spillovers should be a high priority of future research, especially given the importance and optimism which recent energy technology assessments have attached to bioenergy with CCS (Kriegler et al., 2014; Bertram et al., 2015). Third, some low-carbon technologies are now reaching a scale and associated knowledge stock large enough to enable widespread global diffusion even without much additional deployment in the advanced economies that originally developed them. Thus additional (and costly) market-pull subsidies for these technologies in the OECD under a global common goods (knowledge stock creation) perspective—as often advocated in renewable energy policy circles—may no longer be necessary. Our results indicate that solar PV likely falls in this category, but that CCS technologies clearly do not. Lastly, it can be globally optimal for innovative economies to deploy advanced technologies more than what is locally optimal if this enables faster diffusion in less advanced regions that could benefit from the technology. Even if a national policy mandating or incentivizing adoption of low-carbon technologies fails the cost–benefit test when only domestic costs and benefits are considered, it could be justified from a global perspective due to benefits that spill over to other economies. Various international policy remedies might be able to address this potential market failure.",221.86328

Early gas CCS deployment in OECD is higher in the KS + SP scenario than in the KS scenario, and even higher in the KS + SP + CT scenario. This is more evidence that it can be globally optimal for the most advanced economies to deploy new technologies more than is locally optimal due to the spillover benefits that would accrue to other regions. It also implies that technologies become more attractive options if experience gained from installing capacity spills over to other, closely related technologies. The endogenous diffusion formulations reduce gas CCS diffusion in LAF, but to varying degrees. The LAF results seem to be driven by competition with other technologies that are more directly influenced by the different formulations.",221.28686

Fig. 5 contains results for the whole world while Fig. 6 decomposes results by region. The figures show how the installed capacities compare to those of the reference scenario, with positive numbers indicating an increase in installed capacity relative to the reference case and negative numbers indicating a decrease relative to the reference case. The discussion that follows highlights the major implications of our endogenous formulations for the diffusion of low-carbon technologies. Its intention is not to cover all scenario results comprehensively, but to focus on the most compelling findings. Capacity and generation share results for each scenario, in the style of Fig. 4 above, are included in the supplementary material. Replacing the exogenous generation expansion constraints of the reference scenario with endogenous knowledge stock constraints on capacity growth (KS scenario) eliminates virtually all coal CCS deployment that occurs in the reference scenario, which is predominantly in ASIA. Adding the spillover mechanism (KS + SP scenario) and cross-technology spillovers (KS + SP + CT scenario) to the formulation barely influences this result. Unlike nuclear, solar PV, and wind, coal CCS has not yet reached commercial scale and its associated knowledge stock is minimal. With knowledge stock constraints on capacity expansion, it would require either significant time or additional expenditure to bring this technology to scale, and given that it is only competitive within a particular range of carbon prices,  it does not diffuse to a great extent. These findings suggest that energy system optimization models which employ exogenous constraints on the rate of generation expansion may overstate the role that coal CCS could play in reducing electric sector emissions. Our endogenous diffusion formulations have the opposite effect on nuclear deployment, which is far higher under all three endogenous formulations than in the reference case. The vast majority of additional nuclear capacity is added in ASIA, suggesting that it substitutes for eliminated coal CCS capacity. While CCS-coupled generation technologies are still in the development and demonstration phases, nuclear power is a mature technology that has diffused for over half a century. Its associated knowledge stock is comparatively high, particularly in ASIA where a lot of nuclear capacity has been installed recently and continues to be added. With an endogenous diffusion formulation featuring knowledge stock constraints on capacity growth, nuclear continues to diffuse in ASIA at the expense of coal CCS, a less mature technology that could only be deployed in smaller quantities or at great expense for the near future. This suggests that our formulations endogenously respect technology lock-in, which is a major feature of historical energy transitions that is not represented by standard diffusion formulations. Of course, the expansion of nuclear in ASIA could be halted if a major adopter (e.g., China) suffers a nuclear catastrophe, a possibility which is not captured by the deterministic structure of MESSAGE. Biomass CCS diffusion is sensitive to the particular endogenous diffusion formulation applied. Moving from the reference case to knowledge stock constraints on capacity expansion (KS scenario) does not have a consistent or large effect, but requiring that new technologies diffuse spatially from core to rim via knowledge spillovers (KS + SP scenario) greatly attenuates biomass CCS diffusion in developing regions. REF and LAF include biomass CCS in their optimal technology portfolios in the reference scenario, but in the KS + SP scenario, OECD does not deploy biomass CCS early or significantly enough to enable subsequent global diffusion in this century. However, this drastic reduction in biomass CCS deployment does not occur if knowledge spills over across the CCS-coupled generation options (KS + SP + CT scenario). In this case, enough gas CCS deployment takes place in OECD over the next several decades to create a knowledge stock relevant to biomass CCS, which spills over to other regions. Biomass CCS is well-suited to some developing regions, but the results suggest that these regions would likely have to pioneer the technology themselves or be able to appropriate knowledge gained from experience with other forms of CCS generation if they plan to make biomass CCS a major component ofemission reduction strategies. In the reference scenario, ASIA is the first region to make solar PV a large component of the electricity mix, and the endogenous diffusion formulations further increase deployment of solar PV in ASIA. Although OECD was the earliest adopter of solar PV (almost invisible at the top left of Fig. 4), in recent years, solar PV deployment has been great enough to create a knowledge stock capable of stimulating widespread global diffusion without much additional deployment in the advanced economies that originally developed the technology. Note, however, that with spatial diffusion through knowledge spillovers (KS + SP and KS + SP + CT scenarios), OECD deploys more solar PV than in the case where all regions can pioneer new technologies independently (KS scenario). This occurs because MESSAGE is a global energy system optimization model, and even though the additional solar PV may not be locally optimal for OECD, it is evidently globally optimal because it enables faster diffusion in developing regions with better resource potential that rely on spillovers from the core. It is important to note that, in scenarios where they are adopted heavily, solar PV and wind require simultaneous deployment of the electricity storage technology to relax the exogenous cap the model imposes on the intermittent generation share (20%).",221.29232

Fig. 4 shows how the optimal electricity capacity mix of each region evolves over time in the reference scenario. All regions respond to the rising carbon price with a dramatic transition in the electricity sector from fossil fuel generation to low-carbon alternatives. They phase out virtually all fossil generation without CCS by 2060. However, the regions pursue very different technology strategies to reduce their emissions. OECD relies almost exclusively on wind and solar PV. ASIA deploys coal CCS in the middle ofthe century but turns to a combination of solar PV and nuclear as the carbon price escalates.

Replacing this formulation with knowledge stock constraints on capacity growth gives us the scenario-denoted KS. In the KS + SP scenario, new technologies diffuse spatially from core to rim via knowledge spillovers. The addition of technology spillovers across the CCS-coupled generation options yields the final scenario, KS + SP + CT. In all scenarios, we apply the same diagnostic carbon price schedule featured in (Kriegler et al., 2015b) in which the tax begins at $18.50/tCO2 in 2020 and rises 4% annually thereafter.  This tax profile is applied in all scenarios to generate conditions under which the optimizing agent will elect to adopt advanced low-carbon electricity technologies to a significant degree, allowing us to observe their diffusion patterns. The knowledge depreciation rate d is assumed to be 10% per year for all technologies in all regions, a conservative depreciation assumption. Values for the parameters of our endogenous diffusion formulations are based on the historical data analysis of the preceding section. We set g equal to 0.25 and sOECD equal to 674 MW, their mean estimates across the five technologies studied. We set σASIA2000 equal to 0.03. Table 3 summarizes and distinguishes the scenarios on the basis of these diffusion parameters. Referring to Subsection 2.4, for the KS + SP + CT scenario with cross-technology spillovers, the parameters governing spillovers across CCS technologies need to be instantiated using data that decompose CCS plant investment costs into components. One such decomposition was conducted by Rubin et al. (Rubin et al., 2007). Different CCS plant types have two components in common: the CO2 capture and CO2 compression systems. Therefore, based on our formulation, the cross-technology spillover coefficient from one CCS technology to another equals the share of these two components in the recipient technology's total investment cost. We take the data on pulverized coal with CCS and natural gas combined cycle with CCS reported in Rubin et al. (2007) as representative ofthe coal CCS and gas CCS technologies, respectively, in our reduced-form MESSAGE model. Since analogous data for biomass CCS is unavailable, we instantiate spillover coefficients to this technology with the more conservative of the values estimated for coal CCS and gas CCS. The cross-technology spillover coefficients are reported in Table 4. proportions and at different times. Across the regions, the results imply that the role of fossil generation with CCS is to bridge the transition from current fossil generation without CCS to zero- and negative-emission technologies like nuclear, solar PV, wind, and biomass CCS. A plot analogous to Fig. 4 above, but with generation rather than capacity shares, is included in the supplementary material.",221.29059

These parameters are the amount of new capacity that can be added annually per unit ofavailable knowledge stock (g), the start-up value that enables initial deployment of a technology by the core region (sOECD), and the spillover coefficients (σrt). We estimate these parameters by analyzing historical data on additions of coal, gas, nuclear, hydro, and wind electricity capacity in the OECD region. Data on coal, gas, and nuclear come from the Scaling Dynamics of Energy Technologies (SD-ET) database compiled at IIASA (Wilson, 2009). Wilson (Wilson, 2013) personally provided additional data on hydro and wind. For each technology, a time series of annual capacity additions is used to construct a time series of the knowledge stock according to Eq. (1). A scatter plot is constructed with knowledge stock on the horizontal axis and new capacity addition on the vertical axis, each point corresponding to a year in the time series. Envisioning vectors drawn from the origin to each point, the points whose vectors have the greatest slopes correspond to the years when capacity was expanding as fast as possible given the available knowledge stock. These points define a capacity expansion frontier. They are isolated and a least squares regression is implemented to fit a line to this set of points. This line indicates how the maximum possible new capacity addition varies with the knowledge stock. Its slope is an estimate of the parameter g and its vertical intercept is an estimate of the parameter sOECD. This parameter estimation method is illustrated in Fig. 2, which presents data for coal power plants. The graph on the left includes all data points while the graph on the right shows the isolated capacity expansion frontier which is used in our model to constrain the maximum scale-up rate. This estimation method is repeated for all five technologies analyzed. Parameter estimates resulting from this exercise are reported in Table 2. The only spillover coefficient we estimate directly from the data is σASIA2000. The ASIA region is chosen because the REF and LAF regions are institutionally very different today than they were for most of the 20th century covered by the time series data. There is little reason to think, for example, that the ability ofthe Soviet Union to appropriate foreign knowledge in 1965 is representative of the capacity of the REF region to absorb knowledge spillovers in the present. Once σASIA2000 is estimated from the data, all other spillover coefficients are simply this value weighted by the size of the energy system relative to the size of the ASIA energy system in the base year, where size is measured in terms oftotal primary energy consumption. This is a simplifying approximation for other variables that might better reflect absorptive capacity, such as energy R&D spending. For each of the five technologies studied, a scatter plot is constructed in the style of Fig. 2 featuring data for both OECD and ASIA. The knowledge stocks are computed using Eq. (1), so the spillover to ASIA is not captured in the knowledge stock values. Across technologies, we find that the capacity expansion frontier is generally steeper for ASIA than for OECD. This can be explained by the fact that the ASIA knowledge stock as computed using Eq. (1) does not account for knowledge that spilled over from OECD. Alternatively using Eq. (4) to calculate the ASIA knowledge stock and gradually increasing the spillover coefficient from zero would raise the knowledge stock values and effectively shift all the ASIA data points to the right. Increasing the spillover coefficient until the slope of the ASIA capacity expansion frontier matches the slope of the OECD frontier identifies the spillover coefficient value that explains the divergent growth rates. In this way, we generate a σASIA2000 estimate from the data on each technology. The capacity expansion frontiers prior to the incorporation of the spillover effect are depicted in Fig. 3, and σASIA2000 is estimated to exactly account for the difference in their slopes. The historical data analysis yields several interesting observations. The g parameter estimates for coal, gas, and hydro are fairly similar while the estimates for nuclear and wind are considerably higher. This is likely because the early expansion of coal, gas, and hydro required the simultaneous development of electricity transmission and distribution infrastructure as well as growth in end-use demand. Nuclear and wind entered the electricity supply mix later when the necessary infrastructure and demand were already in place, resulting in faster market penetration. It is difficult to detect any coherent spillover effect associated with nuclear. This is not surprising given the important role that political and national security factors play in the adoption of nuclear power.",221.86307

In reality, when two technologies share common components, installing capacity of one technology should contribute to the knowledge stock for the other. This is similar to the central claim of the component-based learning curve approach, in which the overall cost ofa technology is the sum of the costs of its individual components. The cost of each component evolves according to its own cumulative capacity and learning rate, where cumulative capacity reflects the inclusion of the component in units of all technologies that feature it (Yeh and Rubin, 2012). De Feber et al. define a cluster oftechnologies as a “group of technologies sharing a common essential component” (De Feber et al., 2002). The reduced MESSAGE model has just 11 electricity generation technologies, most of which have little in common with the others, but the three forms of CCS-coupled generation comprise one obvious technology cluster. The common essential components are the CO2 capture and CO2 compression systems. Since each CCS technology features these components, adding capacity of one of these technologies should contribute to the knowledge stocks for all three. In this subsection we incorporate cross-technology spillovers for CCS-coupled generation into our technology diffusion formulation. We update the expression for the knowledge stock in Eq.

This is accomplished by selecting a core region through the assignment of start-up values and incorporating knowledge spillovers that allow technology transfer to other regions. We let OECD be the core region. Given how large and varied the other regions are, a distinction between rim and periphery would be arbitrary for the simple model setup in this study, so we refer to all other regions collectively as the rim. While the technological and innovative primacy ofthe OECD economies is subject to debate, especially when looking ahead several decades, there is great reason to believe these countries will pioneer the emerging low-carbon electricity technologies featured in the reduced-form MESSAGE model. The OECD countries accounted for 90% of global wind power capacity in 1990 and still accounted for 81% in 2008 (Wilson, 2013). The United States, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and South Korea are collectively home to 48 of the 62 large-scale integrated CCS pilot projects underway in the world (Global CCS Institute, 2013). More generally, empirical research demonstrates that a small subset of OECD nations drive a substantial fraction of technological progress around the world (Eaton and Kortum, 1999; Verspagen, 1997). However, dependent on the overall scenario storyline (e.g., (Nakićenović and Swart, 2000; O'Neill et al., 2014)) or specific technologies considered (e.g., biomass-based liquid transport fuels), this assumption can be changed easily in the model. Regardless, for the purpose of this study, OECD is assumed to be the core region and it is assigned a start-up value sOECD N0 while the other regions are assigned start-up values sr = 0(r ≠ OECD). Absent a spillover of knowledge from the core, the other regions cannot begin to adopt a new technology. This framework exogenously demands that OECD be the first adopter of all technologies. The diffusion ofa technology from core to rim is governed by a knowledge spillover mechanism. Essentially, capacity units installed in the core contribute at least partially to the knowledge stocks of other regions. Mathematically, the spillover is incorporated into the expression for the knowledge stock. Eq. (4) builds on the foundation of Eq. (2), but includes the spillover mechanism.",221.30365

Energy plant construction times are significant relative to the period length in this study and, given the temporal resolution of the model (10-year time steps), the particular year within a period when new capacity is added is trivial. The formulation constrains the amount of capacity that can be added in one period based on the knowledge stock available at the beginning of that period. The soft terms of the constraint allow the upper bound on new capacity addition to be relaxed, but at significant and marginally increasing cost. The optimizing agent can choose to make these components ofEq. (2) positive, but doing so would add cost to the objective function. Therefore, the agent faces a choice between restricting capacity growth to the level implied by the knowledge stock and start-up value, or relaxing this upper bound for additional cost. In our specification, capacity units installed beyond the soft upper bound are subject to a cost penalty equal to 50% of the normal plant investment cost. Beyond a doubling of the soft upper bound, additional capacity units are exorbitantly expensive. This possibility is incorporated to ensure model feasibility, but the optimizing agent should only elect to exercise this option in an environment of unusually severe constraints or extreme parameter values.

Consider the example of nuclear power in the IEA countries. Although generation is still significant, most operating plants were built several decades ago and cumulative R&D expenditures have been declining since the early 1980s (IEA, 2014). Even with conservative assumptions about knowledge depreciation, the nuclear knowledge stock is lower today than it was at its 1980s peak (Grubler and Nemet, 2012). This important information is lost when constraints are applied to generation. Knowledge, expertise, and engineering capacity—the factors that limit the rate of technology diffusion—are embodied in the physical capital itself, not in generation levels. Therefore, constraining capacity growth is a superior alternative to constraining generation growth. We replace the MESSAGE generation expansion constraints with capacity expansion constraints and specify the additional costs incurred for exceeding soft growth limits based on investment cost instead of levelized cost. Mathematical expressions for these constraints appear later in this subsection. The amount of new capacity installed in a given period is constrained in our model by a region-and-technology-specific knowledge stock. It embodies the knowledge, expertise, and engineering capacity required to add new plants. The knowledge stock is assumed to be a function of prior capacity additions. This simplification ignores other factors that are relevant to installing capacity, such as R&D spending, capital constraints, and infrastructure bottlenecks. Generally speaking, the more capacity that has previously been added, the more new capacity can be installed. This acceleration of the allowed capacity addition during the technology expansion phase resembles the convex portion of the S-shaped logistic growth function frequently used to describe technology diffusion. The flattening out of the diffusion trajectory will be enforced by market saturation effects, but by that point, the knowledge stock constraint on capacity addition will no longer be binding. There is ample evidence to suggest that knowledge, like other forms of capital, depreciates with time. Previous capacity additions do not contribute equally to the current knowledge stock. In particular, capacity installed recently contributes more to the knowledge stock than capacity installed in the distant past because recent capacity additions likely featured current workers, the latest production methods and designs, and so forth. Several studies based on R&D spending and patent citations have estimated knowledge depreciation rates for energy technologies. Wantanabe et al. (Wantanabe et al., 2002) found that knowledge in the Japanese solar PV industry depreciates at a rate of 30% per year. Nemet (Nemet, 2009) identified a 10% knowledge depreciation rate in the American wind turbine industry. In general, energy technologies are characterized by knowledge depreciation rates in the 10–40% range, with the French breeder reactor program establishing the high end of this spectrum (Grubler and Nemet, 2012). Mathematically, let X, R, and T respectively represent the sets of technologies, regions, and time periods included in the model. The sets X and R are defined by Table 1 and Fig. 1, respectively, and T = {0, 1, 2, 3 …}. Let Kr,xt denote the knowledge stock for technology x in region r in period t. Denote the capacity installed in period t as Cr,xt. Let d represent the knowledge depreciation rate. The initial period is denoted t0 and Δ is the period length. With these conventions, the knowledge stock is defined according to Eq. (1). The discount factor is defined such that capacity added in the immediately preceding period contributes to the knowledge stock undiscounted.",221.275876

Several versions of MESSAGE are available, each of which is tailored to research focusing on a different aspect of the linked energy, economic, and environmental systems. The version of MESSAGE selected for this study is a reduced-form version of the model implemented in GAMS and originally designed for analyses examining the roles ofuncertainty and foresight (Krey and Riahi, 2013). It has 10-year time steps, a 2100 time horizon, four regions (Fig. 1), and 11 electricity generation technologies (Table 1). In addition, oil refining, liquid fuel production from coal, gas and biomass as well as hydrogen electrolysis are represented in the model to cover a wide range of primary to final energy supply routes. Energy end-use is modeled in a stylized fashion with three demand categories included: stationary electric demand, stationary thermal demand, and transport fuel demand. Energy savings are incorporated via socalled conservation cost curves that have been derived from the 11-region version of MESSAGE (Rogelj et al., 2013). The model is linear and deterministic. Throughout the remainder of this paper, MESSAGE shall refer to this particular version of the model. It is appropriate because its GAMS framework enables structural modifications and because its limited sets of regions and technologies focus attention on diffusion patterns without unnecessary complexity. In MESSAGE, new technologies become available to each region in an exogenously specified period. For some advanced low-carbon technologies, certain regions gain access before others to reflect the fact that certain regions are more likely to be early adopters. For example, in MESSAGE scenarios such as the one developed for the Global Energy Assessment (Riahi et al., 2012), the assumption is made that the coal CCS and gas CCS technologies are available to OECD as well as China as of 2020 but to the other regions as of 2030 because, from today's perspective, OECD is most likely to be the innovating core region for these technologies. MESSAGE limits diffusion rates by imposing soft constraints on the annual percentage growth of generation for each technology in each region (Keppo and Strubegger, 2010). The constraints are “soft” in that they can be exceeded, but doing so entails significant additional costs. For example, in each region, coal generation is allowed to expand up to 10% annually before additional costs must be incurred to scale up any faster.",221.8655

The diffusion of steam-based coal power in England was slow (spanning most of the 18th and 19th centuries) but very pervasive, ultimately providing almost all the nation's primary energy. England developed an effective infrastructure for mining, transporting, and using coal. The next European nations to adopt coal power were Germany, France, and the Netherlands, which constituted the rim. Benefiting from the earlier experience of England, diffusion in these countries took place much faster. In general, and in accordance with Schmidt's Law, the maximum extent of diffusion in the rim was lower, with coal power saturating at roughly 85% of primary energy in France and the Netherlands. The European periphery for coal power included Spain, Italy, Sweden, and Portugal. Diffusion in the periphery took place later and proceeded at a pace similar to that observed in the rim. The maximum extent of diffusion was much lower in the periphery than anywhere else, which can be explained by several factors. The periphery countries lacked the large coal reserves ofEngland and Germany, never developed as comprehensive a supporting infrastructure for coal, and adopted coal power when new competitors like oil and gas were entering the primary energy mix. It is interesting to note that the regions which adopted coal power earliest and most heavily also retained a large share of coal power the longest as new competitors arose. This is an example of lock-in, the idea that significant technological experience and the existence of a complex infrastructure supporting the incumbent technology help it persist even when superior competitors enter the market. The simple, exogenous constraints used to limit technology diffusion in most energy system optimization models do not respect these empirical observations regarding the spatial dimensions of technology diffusion. They do not distinguish among core, rim, and periphery regions, and do not represent important feedbacks such as knowledge or technology spillover effects where diffusion in one region facilitates adoption in other regions.",221.8633

Instead, rates of adoption, or technology diffusion, observed empirically vary widely spanning time scales ofmonths to years (e.g., for fashion items) to decades, even centuries (as for large-scale, long-lived infrastructures). In turn, diffusion rates and levels depend on a host of factors including characteristics of the technology (e.g., profitability) and characteristics of the adoption environment. The diffusion literature is vast and a comprehensive review is beyond the scope of this paper. A useful literature synthesis is provided through the successive editions of Everett Rogers' Diffusion of Innovations (Rogers, 2003), which the energy and climate-related technology diffusion literature, reviewed here, draws upon. As summarized above, energy system optimization models limit technology diffusion rates due to ample historical evidence indicating that most energy technologies require time scales of decades or even centuries to achieve widespread adoption. Previous studies have computed characteristic diffusion time scales for a wide range of technology transitions, usually defined as the time required to scale up from 10% to 90% of maximum adoption  (Grubler et al., 1999; Wilson, 2009; Nakićenović, 1990; Cleveland, 2012; Meyer et al., 1999; Ray, 1989). Historically observed time scales include 130 years for the transition from traditional renewables to coal steam power and 80 years for the transition from coal to oil, gas, and electricity (Grubler, 2012). End-use technologies typically diffuse faster than supply-side technologies, but heterogeneity is substantial. Global diffusion took place over durations of 60 years for railways (Grubler, 1990), 25 years for basic oxygen steel furnaces (Nakićenović, 1990), and 12 years for substituting steam by diesel or electric locomotives (Grubler et al., 1999). Diffusion rates do not appear to be changing significantly over time, in contrast to the common perception that technologies are being adopted faster in the present than they were in the past (Wilson, 2009). To parameterize diffusion constraints, energy system optimization model developers and users can calculate the equivalent annual growth rates from the empirical data. The slow global diffusion of coal power took place with an annual growth rate ofjust 2% (Iyer et al., 2015). There is no generally accepted theory that explains diffusion rate heterogeneity across technologies, but several factors are considered important. Greater unit scale and larger market size contribute to slower diffusion. Requirements for interrelated technologies or complex infrastructures also hinder the diffusion process (Grubler, 2012). For example, a major obstacle confronting the potential expansion of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles is that it would require significant advances and investments in hydrogen production technologies and distribution networks (Grubler et al., 1999). Certain factors can accelerate diffusion. A powerful one is the presence of niche markets in which the unique performance advantages of a new technology offer a substantial upgrade relative to conventional competitors (Wilson, 2012). The new technology is likely imperfect and expensive, but the market niche shields it from competition and provides valuable opportunities for performance enhancement and cost reduction. History provides many examples of technologies that benefited from such niches. The light water reactor initially thrived as a power source for nuclear submarines, and the benefits of this experience left the technology well placed to diffuse into the civilian electricity sector (Cowan, 1990). Mobile phones benefited from early deployment in recreational boats and automobiles, where the traditional competitor was not a viable option. In the early stages of diffusion, performance is a more important driver of adoption than cost competitiveness. Typically, significant cost reductions only occur once the technology reaches a deployment level capable of supporting standardization and mass production (Wilson, 2012). Diffusion is a spatial (Hagerstrand, 1967) as well as a temporal process, and historical evidence confirms that technologies diffuse at different times, at different rates, and to different extents in different places, and can be significantly influenced by policies (Victor, 1993). An illustrative empirically based theory for technology diffusion across multiple regions is suggested by “Schmidt's Law” (Grubler, 1990). With respect to a specific technology, it divides regions into three groups: core, rim, and periphery. The core is where the technology is invented, subject to experimentation, and first deployed commercially. To develop the technology, the core must have both sufficient innovative ability and economic motivation to make the necessary resource commitment. As the technology spreads from the core to the rim and eventually to the periphery, later adopters have the advantage ofbenefiting from the experiences ofearlier adopters via knowledge spillover effects (Verdolini and Galeotti, 2011). At this point, the technology has likely been refined and costs have likely declined significantly. Schmidt's Law claims that, as a result, diffusion proceeds at a faster rate in regions which adopt the technology later. However, diffusion tends to be less pervasive in regions where adoption is delayed, ultimately saturating at a lower extent than in regions where adoption occurred earlier. This is often attributed to a lack of proper institutions and infrastructures in later adopters, markets which may not be as favorable to a technology, or the availability of yet newer options that invite technological leapfrogging. Empirical evidence supports the validity of Schmidt's Law over a wide range oftechnologies, time periods, and geographical contexts. A recent meta-analysis of technology up-scaling found that diffusion accelerated moving from the core to the rim and periphery for technologies as diverse as natural gas power, oil refineries, and automobiles (Wilson, 2009). One historical example that conforms particularly well to Schmidt's Law is the diffusion of coal power in Europe (Grubler, 2012).",221.874447

Without constraints on technology diffusion, models would initiate a drastic and instantaneous shift in the technology investment portfolio as soon as a new technology becomes cost-competitive with an incumbent. For example, a model might not invest in solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity at all until exogenous technological progress and a rising carbon price make it cost-competitive with fossil generation, causing the model to suddenly switch all its investment from fossil to solar PV. Such behavior is clearly inconsistent with the gradual nature of historical energy transitions (see next subsection), so many energy system optimization models include constraints to limit the rate of deployment of new technologies, or technology growth rates. The standard modeling approach is to impose exogenous constraints on annual scale-up rates for individual technologies within each region. These diffusion constraints are specified in either absolute or percentage terms. Heterogeneous maximum scale-up rates can be applied to different technologies and possibly to different regions. Models that include advanced technology options which are currently in development or envisioned for the future exogenously specify when these technologies will become available. These availability dates may or may not vary by region. Models with percentage growth constraints that include technologies which do not currently constitute an appreciable portion of the technology mix must allow for some amount of deployment in the initial adoption period. The popular and well-documented Market Allocation (MARKAL) model, developed and maintained by the IEA, is a quintessential energy system optimization model with a standard technology diffusion formulation. It exogenously imposes maximum annual growth rates on capacity expansion and also enables the user to place exogenous upper bounds on total capacity or investment in new capacity (Loulou et al., 2004). For technologies that have not yet been deployed, MARKAL allows for some initial build in the first adoption period. The IEA has recently developed The Integrated MARKAL-EFOM System (TIMES) as a successor to MARKAL (Loulou and Labriet, 2007; Loulou, 2007). TIMES has some additional features but its reference energy system and description of technologies are largely inherited from MARKAL. As MARKAL and TIMES are model generators used in many different applications, diffusion constraint parameterizations depend on the particular implementation. The upgraded Dynamic New Earth 21 (DNE21+) energy system optimization model, maintained by the Research Institute of Innovative Technology for the Earth in Japan, provides global coverage with many regions and technologies (Akimoto et al., 2012; Akimoto et al., 2004). It has been included in major inter-model comparison studies including the aforementioned AMPERE and EMF 27 projects. DNE21+ imposes a percentage scale-up constraint on nuclear power generation, but not on other technologies. It also places exogenous upper bounds on wind, solar PV, and nuclear generation as shares of total generation (RITE Systems Analysis Group, 2009; Krey, 2011). Availability dates are exogenously specified for new technologies; for example, CCS generation options can be deployed starting in 2020. The Regionalized Model of Investments and Development (REMIND) operated at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research employs adjustment costs to allow an acceleration of technology diffusion compared to average technology deployment (Leimbach et al., 2010). The Joint Global Change Research Institute's Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM) is a recursive-dynamic IAM rather than an energy system optimization model. Although GCAM does not normally feature explicit technology scale-up constraints, the AMPERE study which employed GCAM to analyze the implications ofdiffusion limits for climate stabilization pathways added exogenous generation growth constraints on top of the model's logit choice technology selection formulation (Iyer et al., 2015). As these examples demonstrate, energy system optimization models typically limit technology diffusion through some combination of exogenously specified availability dates and exogenous constraints on capacity or generation growth, level, and share. MESSAGE, the energy system optimization framework utilized in this study, represents technology diffusion in much the same manner.

The goals of such assessments vary, but common objectives are to develop scenarios for the adoption of a technology, determine its economic value, evaluate its environmental impact, and investigate how these results change under different assumptions about end-use demands, technological change, climate policy, and other parameters. In this subsection, we briefly review some recent, multi-model energy technology assessments to demonstrate how IAMs are applied in this context and highlight the challenges that arise. The Stanford Energy Modeling Forum Study 27 (EMF 27) examined the role of technology for achieving climate policy objectives by comparing results from 18 IAMs (Weyant and Kriegler, 2014). Scenarios varied in their assumptions about technology availability, placing different constraints on technologies like nuclear, bioenergy, solar, wind, and carbon capture and storage (CCS). For each technology scenario, the models produce a range of global mitigation costs required to meet 450 ppm and 550 ppm atmospheric carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) concentration targets. Comparing the cost ranges across technology scenarios establishes the value of individual technologies, or groups of technologies, for meeting the climate policy objective. The study results suggest that bioenergy and CCS are particularly valuable mitigation technologies due to their potential applications beyond the electricity generation sector and their combined ability to produce negative emissions (Kriegler et al., 2014). Similar to EMF 27, the European Union's Adaptation and Mitigation Strategies—Supporting European Climate Policy (ADAM) project employed a collection of IAMs to assess the value and competitive potential of certain energy technologies for achieving low atmospheric GHG concentration targets (Edenhofer et al., 2015). Across the participating models, the ranking of individual technology options by importance was fairly robust (Edenhofer et al., 2010). Renewables and CCS are the most valuable technologies, and biomass is also important if its availability is high and the climate target is ambitious. Nuclear was found to be of lesser importance. Many energy transition pathways are possible to achieve modest climate policy goals, but stringent targets imply heavy reliance on particular technologies and a loss of flexibility to substitute technologies within the energy mix. The project results suggest that understanding limits to the availability of technologies with potentially adverse side effects, such as bioenergy and CCS, should be a high priority of future research. The Report on Energy and Climate Policy in Europe (RECIPE) project analyzed the economic and technical dimensions of decarbonization using three IAMs and a variety of policy and technology scenarios (Edenhofer et al., 2012). Echoing the results of the ADAM studies, the RECIPE project findings indicate that CCS and renewables are the most valuable low-carbon technology options due to their flexibility and broad applicability (Tavoni et al., 2011). Nuclear is again found to have comparatively lesser importance. Prospects for renewables are highly sensitive to assumptions about technological change and diffusion. The project demonstrates the importance of building a diversified portfolio of mitigation technologies and fostering technological innovation. The Assessment of Climate Change Mitigation Pathways and Evaluation of the Robustness of Mitigation Cost Estimates (AMPERE) project, funded by the European Union, analyzed the effects of delayed international action to address climate change on the achievability of long-term climate policy goals (Kriegler et al., 2015a). Several studies in this project evaluated the effects of near-term policy choices on energy transitions throughout this century. An analysis featuring nine IAMs (Bertram et al., 2015) found that delayed climate policy implementation causes significantly more coal capacity to be installed over the next several decades. To meet a long-term climate goal such as limiting warming to 2 °C above preindustrial temperatures, much ofthis coal capacity would need to be prematurely retired and bioenergy with CCS would need to be deployed to produce negative emissions. Another AMPERE study determined that if bioenergy with CCS is unavailable in the long-term, the optimal transition to a low-carbon energy system includes much greater emission reductions in the near-term (Eom et al., 2015). The majority of this transition occurs in the period 2030–2050, with nuclear, solar, and wind power all scaling up dramatically, particularly if CCS is banned. The project also found that limits on diffusion rates of low-carbon technologies become more formidable obstacles to climate stabilization if mitigation is delayed (Iyer et al., 2015). Constraints on the market penetration of CCS and renewables are more costly than those on nuclear and bioenergy. A combination of delayed policy action and stringent diffusion rate limits renders ambitious long-term climate policy objectives infeasible. The conclusions of IAM-based energy technology assessments are only as credible as the structural and parametric assumptions contained in the models. To model extremely complex socioeconomic systems, IAMs necessarily resort to simplified representations that abstract away from the innumerable interactions and factors that are present in reality. One important process that IAMs model in a very simplified fashion is technology diffusion. In the next subsection, we describe how energy system optimization models typically represent technology diffusion. Our focus is on this class of IAMs because energy system optimization models include the most technological detail and offer the most transparent structural framework for diffusion analyses. In Subsection 1.4, we review historical evidence on the diffusion of energy technologies to investigate whether the model formulations properly respect empirically observed patterns.",221.86455

Growing concern about climate change has led governing bodies at all levels to implement or at least to consider policies to reduce emissions. Example policy instruments include emissions pricing, emissions trading schemes with quantity limits, renewable portfolio standards, and feed-in tariffs. A key question is how do these policies affect the market deployment of different technology options—and hence GHG emissions—and how do policies in one jurisdiction (e.g., a country) potentially affect the market uptake of new technologies in other jurisdictions. These research questions are traditionally explored via formal models and in assessing alternative future policy and technology scenarios. To evaluate the economic and environmental consequences ofpotential climate policies, researchers have developed a host of integrated assessment models (IAMs) that combine elements of the linked energy, economic, and environmental systems (including land-use) in a unified inter-disciplinary framework (Wilkerson et al., 2015). The primary intention of IAMs is not to provide exact forecasts, but rather to suggest plausible future scenarios based on model assumptions about population growth, economic growth, technological change, and other factors (Moss et al., 2010). These models feature a diverse set of methodologies, and several attempts have been made to classify them into distinct categories (Schneider and Lane, 2005; Schneider, 1997; Stanton et al., 2009). Although these taxonomies differ, it is fairly straightforward to identify several broad classes of IAMs that differ in terms of level of integration, detail represented, and the applied solution method, each with distinct strengths and weaknesses that make it well suited for certain applications and research questions, but not others. Cost–benefit IAMs contain reduced-form representations of the climate system and represent feedbacks from the climate to the economy. By placing an economic value on damages caused by GHG emissions, these models weigh the benefits ofreducing emissions against the costs it would entail. Cost–benefit IAMs are designed to address the question of the best climate policy, such as an optimal carbon price schedule. They are typically simple and transparent in structure, but feature little (if any) regional or technological detail. Cost–benefit IAMs include the DICE, FUND, and PAGE models employed by the Interagency Working Group on Social Cost of Carbon to inform U.S. government policy (Interagency Working Group on Social Cost of Carbon, 2010). General equilibrium IAMs include detailed representations of the economy, often disaggregated into different regions and sectors. Firms maximize profit, consumers maximize utility, and the model solves for the equilibrium prices that equilibrate supply and demand across all markets. Most general equilibrium models rely on a recursive-dynamic solution approach rather than an inter-temporal optimization scheme. General equilibrium IAMs are well suited for evaluating the economic impact of a policy, particularly when feedbacks between economic sectors could be significant. Partial equilibrium IAMs follow a similar modeling paradigm but solve for equilibrium prices only within certain markets of interest such as energy commodities or electricity generation. The EPPA model (Paltsev et al., 2005) is a prototypical general equilibrium IAM, while GCAM (Kim et al., 2006) is representative ofpartial equilibrium models. IAMs based on energy system optimization models take the perspective of an energy system planner whose problem is to select the set ofenergy technology investments that minimizes total cost subject to a variety of constraints. These constraints reflect the need to meet energy end-use demands, the finite availability of energy resources, limits on technology diffusion rates, and possibly caps on GHG emission quantities. Energy system optimization IAMs often feature many technologies represented in great parametric detail, including fixed and variable costs, conversion efficiencies, capacity factors, and lifetimes. As a result, these models are frequently applied to assess the prospects for, or value of, individual energy technologies under a range ofassumptions. Examples ofthis model class include TIAM (Loulou and Labriet, 2007; Loulou, 2007), based on the MARKAL/TIMES energy system model (Loulou et al., 2004),",221.264662

The current analysis shows several of the EMF-22 scenarios to be infeasible under the current IMAGE framework set-up. However, the infeasibility does depend on various factors. For instance, the definition of radiative forcing targets on the basis of Kyoto gases only means that in the short-term radiative forcing levels are higher— making stabilisation scenarios more difficult to achieve. The results of the EMF-22 exercise can therefore not be directly compared to some other studies (including the new IPCC scenarios). Similarly, including overshoot profiles allows for lower targets to be feasible. Finally, the inclusion of bio-energy and carbon-capture-and-storage significantly influences the feasibility (and costs) ofdifferent targets. Both BECS and allowance for overshoot lead to a slightly delayed emission profile.

First of all, developing country participation is considerably delayed (until 2030 for group 2; until 2050 for other developing countries). While full participation by 2012 is arguably not a realistic result of current international negotiations, more intermediate scenarios might also be achievable. Secondly, several regions now included in group 3 could be eligible for participation at an earlier time. There are several advanced developing countries or regions identifiable in this group that have per capita income levels above the average per capita income level in group 2, for example Mexico and the rest of Central America, Argentina, Middle East and South-Korea. Thirdly, the current model set-up does not explore new types of contributions from the non-Annex I countries in-between a voluntary non-binding approach under the Kyoto Protocol and the binding absolute reduction targets of current Annex I countries. These intermediate contributions, like sectoral targets, sectoral CDM, no lose emission targets or sustainable development policies and measures, allow for using the mitigation potential in developing countries—and still allow for low costs in developing countries. Finally, not all of the presently known mitigation options, like reducing emissions from deforestation are included in our present modelling framework.

This may have important implications. Fig. 9 shows the resulting transient temperature increase for the pathways of overshoot 2.6 and 2.9 W/m2 and compares these with the equilibrium temperature increase for a stabilisation profile at 2.6 W/m2. Given the inertia in the climate system, a stabilisation 2.6 W/ m2 profile leads to ongoing warming beyond 2100 until temperature reaches equilibrium. For the overshoot scenarios, the post-2100 warming depends on assumptions on post-2100 forcing. Given the decreasing forcing and temperature levels in 2100, one logical extension would be to assume that in these scenarios forcings continue to decrease, effectively preventing some of the temperature increase (“committed warming”) that would still occur after this concentration peak. In this way, in terms of temperature increase effects, overshoot profiles can be more effective than stabilisation profiles (for details see den Elzen and van Vuuren (2007)). This implies that while the EMF study focused on the 2.6 W/m2 scenario—from an environmental perspective the study could just as well have focused on an overshoot 2.9 W/m2 scenario. And while a stabilisation target is considerably more stringent (and thus more expensive), the resulting gains in reducing temperature increase might be relatively small.",251.177316

As climate change depends on the total forcing (and not on the Kyoto-gas only forcing), the focus on the Kyoto-gas only forcing is arguably artificial. The effect of both definitions is illustrated in Fig. 8 for the full participation 3.7 W/m2 overshoot and 2.6 W/m2 BECS overshoot scenario. By excluding the non-Kyoto forcing agents, current radiative forcing is higher (mainly by not including the cooling effect of sulphur aerosols). This “Kyoto gas” radiative forcing remains above the total radiative forcing for the whole period until 2070–2080.

The stabilisation scenario requires early action: as overshoot is not allowed, the flexibility in the emission reductions is limited. This leads to high prices in the group 1 region until 2030 in order to reduce emissions fast enough. After 2030, the group 2 region gradually enters the carbon trading market, and this initially lowers the price, but by 2050 it reaches maximum levels again. These high prices are needed to achieve sufficient action in both group 1 and 2 regions. After 2050, the price decreases to lower levels due to the participation of group 3. Under the overshoot 3.7 W/m2 scenario the reduction action in the group 1 and 2 regions are postponed after 2050 to avoid these high price peaks before 2050. It also leads to a consistently increasing carbon price in the overshoot scenario, which differs from the double peaking price pathway under the 3.7 /m2 stabilisation scenario. 4.2.2. Energy use There are little changes in the energy system from a global perspective. Global total primary energy use remains almost unchanged compared to the full participation case. Regions that participate in reductions generally show an increase in biofuel use with a marginally reduced preference for coal. 4.2.3. Abatement costs The delayed participation highly influences the total abatement costs, and the resulting total cumulative discounted abatement costs, in particular for the 3.7 W/m2 scenarios (Fig. 5, middle). In case of the 3.7 W/m2 overshoot scenario the total cumulative discounted costs by 2100 increase by about 25% compared to the costs under the full participation scenario. The costs increase is relatively modest as a result of the flexibility in emission reduction: the delayed participation also leads to a delay in emission reduction. However, for the stabilisation 3.7 W/m2 scenario costs increase significantly by some 90%. Avoiding an overshoot in the radiative forcing requires early action and as there is little flexibility in the timing of reduction action, this leads to a steeper increase in the regional permit prices, as was explained before. For the more stringent radiative forcing targets, costs increases cannot be assessed—as the mitigation target becomes infeasible if run under the delayed response assumption in this study. For the 4.5 W/m2 scenarios, the differences are relatively small (less than 5%). Again, this is a consequence of the fact that emission reductions under this scenario are clearly delayed anyway.",251.06123

Because of little demand in the period 2030–2040 the carbon price in the group 2 region grows to the price in the group 1 region within the 20 year transition period. Even the carbon price in group 3 exceeds the global permit price level by 2060 (as a result of the inertia and delayed learning).

For the group 2 region, the delay in action until 2030 is compensated by steep reductions after 2030. The total emissions across the century are in fact lower compared to the full participation scenario. Group 3 delays (by design) its emission reductions until 2050.

At the same time, the contribution of other mitigation options decreases (e.g. the short-term reliance on energy efficiency improvement). • As a result of the considerable delay in participation of groups 2 and 3 that is assumed (30–50 years), the most stringent radiative forcing targets (2.6 and 2.9 W/m2) become unattainable in our framework.

Large-scale use ofthe latter type of technology in fact means that even by 2100 coal use under the mitigation cases is larger than today (although less than in the baseline). The same holds for natural gas. In contrast, oil use is substantially reduced, partly as a result of depletion.

The results focus on the implications for emissions, radiative forcing, abatement costs and the energy system. 4.1.1. Emission pathways and concentration profiles Fig. 3 shows the outcomes for emissions and radiative forcing based on the cost-optimal pathways.  There are considerable differences between the emission pathways of the different full participation scenarios mostly resulting from the differences in target level. For the scenario that aims at stabilisation at 4.5 W/m2, emissions reach a level of about 27.5 GtCO2e/yr by 2100, i.e. about a third of baseline emissions. For the scenarios aimed at 3.7 W/m2, emissions need to be reduced further, to roughly a quarter of global emissions in 2100 (about 18 GtCO2e/yr). Finally, there is a group ofscenarios aimed at reaching a 2.9 and 2.6 W/m2 radiative forcing. These scenarios have emissions of 7–15 GtCO2e/yr by 2100. The remaining GHG emissions include little (in the case of 2.9 W/m2) to no (in the case of 2.6) CO2 emissions. A second factor that influences emission trajectories is the role of overshoot vs. stabilisation. This can be seen clearly for the 3.7 W/m2 scenarios. The overshoot 3.7 W/m2 scenario reduces emissions less in the short-term and compensates this by stronger reductions in the second half of the century. In 2050, this implies more than 40% reduction of global emissions for the stabilisation case, and only 30% for the overshoot case. The lowest targets (2.9 and 2.6 W/m2) are only feasible for the overshoot cases. Clearly, the timing ofpeaking in global emissions is also a function of the stabilisation level and the allowance of overshoot. For the 4.5 W/m2 scenario global emissions peak by 2050, whereas for 2.6 and 2.9 W/m2 this peaking is even before 2020. Allowing an overshoot for 3.7 W/m2 clearly delays the peaking till 2040.",251.04595

Most of this growth occurs in the group 2 and group 3 regions (about 80%). The global energy system continues to be dominated by fossil fuels. While early on, natural gas and oil continue to have a high share, by the end of the century both fuels lose market share to coal (natural gas in the power sector), biofuels and hydrogen mostly produced from coal. As a result, energy-sector CO2 emissions continue to rise for most of the century, by 2100 reaching some 75 GtCO2. By 2100, the shift to coal use (for both electricity and hydrogen production) contributes to a further increase in emissions, despite a stabilising population and a slowing-down of growth in energy use. The scenario is rather optimistic about agricultural technology (“adaptive mosaic” scenario, (Alcamo et al., 2006)), and as a result the agricultural area stabilises after 2030. The total anthropogenic land-use related CO2 emissions (5.5 GtCO2 in 2000) stay above 3.5 GtCO2 throughout the century. However, as uptake by regrowing vegetation is increasing, the net land-use emissions decrease over time, to nearly zero emissions after 2050 (Fig. 2). Agriculture related emissions for the non-CO2 GHGs grow over time—but at a much slower rate than CO2 emissions from energy.

The land modules of IMAGE describe the dynamics of agriculture and natural vegetation, including potentials for biofuels under resulting climate change, and the land-use related emissions of GHGs. The global energy model, TIMER, as part of the IMAGE model, describes the primary and secondary demand and production of energy and the related emissions of GHGs and regional air pollutants (van Vuuren et al., 2007). The FAIR–SiMCaP model is a combination of the abatement costs model of the FAIR model and the SiMCaP model (den Elzen and Meinshausen, 2006; den Elzen et al., 2007; den Elzen and van Vuuren, 2007). The FAIR cost model distributes the difference between baseline and global emission pathway following a least-cost approach using regional Marginal Abatement Costs (MAC) curves for the different emissions sources (den Elzen et al., 2007). More specifically, the MAC curves for energy-and industry-related CO2 emissions were determined with the TIMER energy model (van Vuuren et al., 2007) by imposing a carbon tax and recording the induced reduction of CO2 emissions. This has been further improved compared to earlier work by now including four instead of two different tax profiles. We now capture the full range of possible tax paths that represent early action and highly delayed action. The MAC curves for carbon plantations were derived using the IMAGE model (Strengers et al., 2008). MAC curves from the EMF-21 project (Weyant et al., 2006) were used for non-CO2 GHG emissions. These curves have been made consistent with the baseline used here and made time-dependent to account for technology change and removal of implementation barriers (Lucas et al., 2007). It should be noted that while CO2 emission reductions from the energy system are described accounting for dynamic processes such as induced learning and limited capital turn-over rates, reductions for non-CO2 gases are based on simple MAC curves (that change over time, but do not limit reduction potential based on a vintage structure). The SiMCaP pathfinder module makes use of an optimisation procedure to find least-cost, multi-gas emission pathways over the 2005–2100 time period that correspond to a predefined climate target. The recently added intertemporal optimisation was set to minimize the cumulative discounted abatement costs. The discount rate applied here is 5%. Furthermore a maximum reduction rate of 3% was assumed (for the BECS scenarios 4%), reflecting the technical (and political) inertia that limits emission reductions, avoiding premature replacement of existing fossil fuel-based capital stock. As reduction rates in existing scenarios hardly exceed 2.5% per year (Swart et al., 2002). Global climate and GHG concentration calculations make use of the simple ‘climate’ model, MAGICC 4.1 (Wigley and Raper, 2001, 2002; Wigley, 2003). The climate model of MAGICC is a simple upwelling-diffusion energy balance model. The carbon cycle model describes fluxes between six global reservoirs (oceans, atmosphere, and four terrestrial carbon stores). For radiative forcing levels, MAGICC 4.1 is calibrated on the information of the Third Assessment Report (Ramaswamy et al., 2001). The model framework calculates emissions of all greenhouse gases (GHGs), ozone precursors (volatile organic compounds, CO, and NOx), and sulfur aerosols (SO2) from energy and land-use related sources, atmospheric concentrations, radiative forcing, and resulting climate change. The analysis consists of the following steps (Fig. 1): 1. The baseline emission scenario is constructed using the models TIMER (energy) and IMAGE (land). These models also provide information on the potentials and abatement costs of reducing emissions from the energy and land-use systems. 2. The FAIR–SiMCaP model is used to develop global emission pathways that lead to a long-term target ofthe atmospheric GHG concentration. The FAIR model distributes the global emission reduction from baseline to meet the global emission pathway, assuming a cost-optimal implementation of available reduction options over time, different regions, gases and sources, based on the information in step 1. 3. The scenarios are implemented in the TIMER model to identify changes in the energy system. direct additional costs due to climate policy, but do not capture the macro-economic implications of these costs. We also do not account for (avoided) damages and adaptation costs of climate change.",251.742978

The advantage of full participation regimes is that they allow for full flexibility in implementing the least expensive emission reductions throughout all countries, sources and sectors, lowering the costs for meeting the overall emission target. The disadvantage is that it is far from easy to achieve global agreement on such comprehensive regimes—and one may argue that in the short-term assuming full participation is not realistic. It should be noted, however, that in reality the difference is not clear cut. Even under a full participation regime, countries could have a limited contribution in emission reductions allowing them to become a net seller of emission credits. And under partial participation regimes, flexible instruments like the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), may allow for some form of flexibility.",251.74359

In recent years, many more studies have explored the costs and feasibility ofachieving stabilization targets that could lead to avoiding a 2 °C increase in global mean temperature compared to pre-industrial levels. These studies showed such scenarios to be feasible under certain conditions, with costs typically in the order of a few percent of GDP (in terms of GDP losses). These costs, however, are strongly influenced by other assumptions. Both van Vuuren et al. (2007) and Knopf et al. (2009) show that the availability of different technologies, including the option of Bio-Energy and carbon-Capture-and-Storage (BECS) could critically influence costs and even the feasibility of targets. den Elzen and van Vuuren (2007) show that costs also strongly depend on whether one allows a limited overshoot of concentration targets.

So-far, the number of scenario studies that aim at low GHG concentration targets is still relatively scarce (for an overview see Fisher et al., 2007). Almost all ofthese studies analyse the implication of low concentration targets under the idealized assumption that all regions and sectors participate in full emissions trading without any restrictions (first-best worlds). This implies that there is full flexibility with respect to the question where and when emission reductions take place allowing for least costs solutions (so-called full when and where flexibility). Only a limited number of studies explored the possibility of achieving GHG concentration or radiative forcing targets in situations where not all regions contribute to mitigation (like Russ et al., 2005; Keppo and Rao, 2007; Richels et al., 2007; Edmonds et al., 2008; Russ et al., 2009). As a result, limited insight exists on the level and timing of global abatement costs for a more realistic scenario assuming limited participation (i.e. participation gradually develops in time including more countries and/or sectors). Similarly, limited insight exists on the attainability of low concentration targets under these imperfect conditions. In particular, the timing of participation of major emitting developing countries, like China and India, in a reduction regime is likely to play an important role. This paper forms part of the EMF-22 model comparison study of international transition scenarios that explores the impact of staged participation on the costs ofstabilizing CO2-equivalent concentrations (Clarke et al., 2009-this issue). In the experiments, full participation regimes are compared to regimes with delayed participation by Russia and the non-Annex I countries (a full definition of regions and timing of participation is given in Section 2.2). This paper describes the results ofthe experiments run with the IMAGE framework (i.e. IMAGE, TIMER and FAIR models) (Bouwman et al., 2006). The model ran for satisfying targets at 4.5, 3.7, 2.9 and 2.6 W/m2 by 2100 (including and excluding an overshoot) and sensitivity tests. In this paper, we first describe the model framework (Section 2), and the baseline assumptions (Section 3), and then focus on the mitigation scenarios (Section 4). We briefly discuss the impact of the assumptions made by EMF-22 on the results (Section 5) and finish with drawing general conclusions (Section 6).",251.741816

Kyoto GHG emissions in all feasible scenarios with immediate and delayed participation and the standard technology portfolio as well as the first-best 2.6 W/m2 overshoot scenario without bioenergy CCS and the constrained nuclear baseline scenario. 10 The combination ofbioenergy and CCS turns out to be highly attractive in stringent stabilization scenarios, because at a carbon price in the range of 100—150 $/tCO2 the energy output (electricity or hydrogen) becomes just a byproduct of the main purpose which is removing carbon from the atmosphere. 11 Note that no explicit restriction of the geological storage potential is implemented in MESSAGE, but due to the large uncertainties of existing estimates, the amount of CO2 stored in the scenarios is evaluated ex post. 12 CCS can also become economically feasible in non-intervention scenarios, due to co-benefits of the captured CO2, e.g. for use in enhanced oil and gas recovery. However, the potential for these applications is limited and therefore CCS deployment in baseline scenarios is typically constrained to a relatively low level compared to stabilization scenarios. 13 As nuclear is deployed well beyond current levels in the baseline scenario, it is not as straightforward to compare no nuclear scenarios with the standard case, because the underlying baseline scenario is also changing. To estimate, for instance, additional costs of a no nuclear stabilization scenario, the cost change of the no nuclear baseline scenario has to be taken into account as well. 15 For example, the production costs of biofuels are accounted for in the producing region, even if exported to another region. In particular the low stabilization scenarios include significant trade of, e.g., biofuels, which can be produced more efficiently in the South and are exported to the North.",251.51277

We find that overall, the fully coupled models yield similar results as our previous study  using loosely linked models, especially for global primary energy use, biofuel production, and agricultural prices. By allowing the interactions and feedbacks, however, managed and natural forest lands are around 10% more productive and pasture land 10% less productive by 2100. In contrast productivity of crop land and natural grass land are little affected by the coupling. When the biofuel option is implemented in the Energy-Only and Energy+Land scenarios, more managed forest land is diverted for biofuel production, especially in Africa, Latin America, and United States. Other modeling studies  have not included the tight coupling used here, nor have they had agriculture, energy, and forest sectors represented in an economy-wide model. The economy-wide model includes adjustments to prices on several margins (intensification of production on existing land, reduced food consumption and shifts away from land intensive livestock products) and a land supply elasticity that reflects institutional protection of forested land. Some studies have found complete loss of natural forestland in a carbon pricing scenario that does not include land.  Failure to include adjustments on multiple margins and resistance to deforestation for recreation and other values appears to have exaggerated the effect of land carbon pricing in these studies, with carbon difference of 300 to 400 Pg C, more than twice our estimate. Our approach to create incentives for carbon storage does include incentives to avoid leakage, but it depends on an idealized system that is in place worldwidethus it reflects the most we might hope to get from land carbon sequestration. Less than ideal systems with incomplete geographical coverage would suffer from leakage and generate less carbon storage but also smaller impacts on food prices. If implemented as a price instrument, then the quantity of abatement is uncertain and severe carbon loss from increases in fire or disease due to climate change, for example, could undermine benefits of reforestation. If implemented as a quantity constraint, leakage from land carbon would need to be offset by additional reductions in emissions from other sources, which could, in turn, increase the costs of meeting the target and have larger impacts on food prices. These trade-offs raise the stakes in international negotiations regarding the burden-sharing associated with climate agreements and compensation for direct and indirect effects of reduction measures. *SSupportingInformation Complete description of the EPPA model and TEM; results and discussion about energy related economy, regional carbon dynamics.

The estimates include CO2 from burning and decay of vegetation and release of carbon as CO2 from disturbed soils. With the No-Biofuel and Energy+Land scenarios, even though some regions continue to clear land for food and/or biofuels production, globally the REDD-like policy results in some regions of the tropics becoming less of a net carbon source or even a net carbon sink over the century (Figure 4). 3.4. Prices for Agricultural Products. Even with continued increase in agricultural productivity, the combination of the need to feed ten billion people and the additional stress of environmental change on the agricultural system increases global food prices by 22% by 2100 in the No-Policy scenario (Figure 5). This is accompanied by a 5-fold increase in global GDP per capita, with the share of food in total consumption falling from the current 15% to 7% by 2100. The food demand increase with income is lower in developed countries so that the food share in these regions is only about 2.5% in 2100, while it remains at 11% in China, 15% in Middle East and less developed Asian countries, and ∼20% in Africa. The effects on agricultural prices of the Energy-Only scenario are offsetting, as the benefits for the agricultural system of avoided environmental damage are largely offset by the increased cost of land and of energy and other greenhouse gas controls due to the mitigation policy. In contrast, in the No-Biofuel and Energy +Land scenario, average price increases of food, crops, livestock, and forest products are much higher than in the other two scenarios. Livestock prices are affected both by increases in pasture rents, as well as increases in feed grain prices. Forest product prices also rise substantially because land is a large cost share in production. Impacts on food prices are moderated by the fact that the additional value-added components of food sector production are not directly affected by the pricing of land carbon. The incentive to reforest immediately leads commodity prices to diverge substantially from the other scenarios in the near term even though the carbon uptake is only gradually realized. Compared with the No-Policy scenario, the regional food consumption shares in the Energy+Land scenario are decreased to 0.5% in USA, 18% in Africa, and 10.6% in China. The MIT IGSM framework with a dynamically linked EPPA and TEM represents the entire global economy, including agriculture, forestry, pasture land and natural forest and grasslands explicitly. As such we are able to focus on a multistress analysis where changing climate and atmospheric chemistry (i.e., carbon dioxide, ozone), combined with a growing population and income that increases the demand for food and forest products and land devoted to such production, are resolved together with potential demand for land for biofuels and carbon sequestration in forests to mitigate climate change. It advances the methodology applied previously  by fully coupling the EPPA and TEM components of the IGSM. The previous effort focused on the partial effect of biofuels by creating model experiments whether biofuels were available or not. The current effort looks at different climate policy regimes and the combined effect they have on stocks of carbon stored in vegetation and soils, and the implications for energy, especially biofuels, and for the price of food and agricultural products.",240.17464

We credit biofuels production equal to (1-θ) per GJ of biofuel used when land carbon is priced. 2.3. Dynamic Linkage between EPPA and TEM. Climate policy, land-use changes, energy production, and economic activities are highly interactive. To account for these interactions and feedbacks, a dynamic linkage between EPPA and TEM has been developed for passing information on changes in land productivities and land management iteratively between the two models (Figure 1). Changes of net primary productivity, simulated by TEM, are used to represent the changes of land productivity due to changing climate and the levels of CO2 and O3. The change of land productivity is one of the important factors to affect land use and land-use changes in EPPA. Because the EPPA model simulates the global economy using a 5-year time step, and the TEM estimates carbon and nitrogen fluxes on a monthly step, the dynamic linkage between EPPA and TEM are developed on a five-year basis. The linkage consists of five steps. First, TEM runs for five years using known information on climate and atmospheric composition estimated from an atmospheric chemistry and climate model and an initial land cover and management from Hurtt et al.  to determine monthly net primary production (NPP) for this initial 5-year time period. Second, the monthly NPP estimates from TEM are aggregated to 5-year mean annual NPP values for each of the EPPA land sectors in each of the EPPA regions and for each grid cell for later downscaling. Third, the EPPA model uses the aggregated NPP estimates from TEM to predict changes in the land shares for each of the EPPA regions. Fourth, the changes in land shares in each of the EPPA regions are then downscaled to the 0.5° latitude × 0.5° longitude spatial resolution using a statistical approach based on climate and gridded 5-year mean NPP estimates and mapped to the land classes used by TEM.  Fifth, the projected land cover obtained from the downscaling is then used along with updated climate data from the atmospheric chemistry and climate model to run TEM to estimate NPP for the next five years. This procedure linking TEM to EPPA continues for each 5-year time step throughout the 21st century. 2.4. Development of the Scenarios. For this study, we develop four scenarios to explore possible linkages between climate and land use as the world’s population grows and becomes wealthier: 1) a No-Policy scenario that assumes no climate policy, continued economic growth and land productivity growth of 1% per year; 2) an Energy-Only scenario that assumes a worldwide common GHG tax applied to all emissions except CO2 emissions from land-use change, starting at $26/t CO2, rising at 4% per year to $730/t by the end of century; 3) a No-Biofuel scenario that extends carbon pricing in 2) to land but allows no biofuel production; and 4) an Energy +Land scenario that extends 3) and allows biofuel production. The No-Biofuel and Energy+Land policies create incentives to sequester and store carbon in vegetation and soil. 3.1. Climate Change Projection. Underlying our results, continued regional population growth as projected by the United Nations,  region-specific economic growth globally averaging 2.3% per year, continued increases in agricultural and energy productivity, continued structural transition in poorer regions that leads to greater commercial energy use, and a shift toward more meat consumption are assumed. In the absence of climate policy (No-Policy scenario) these factors lead to a global mean temperature increase of ∼5.8 °C by 2100 from preindustrial, with the CO2 concentration at more than 900 ppmv in comparison to the current ∼400 ppmv (Figure 2a and 2b). The projected temperature increase will require considerable adaptation of many human systems and will leave some aspects of the earth’s environment irreversibly changed.  An ambitious global Energy-Only policy reduces our estimate of warming from the likely catastrophic ∼5.8 °C increase above preindustrial to 2.7 °C and CO2 to ∼520 ppmv (Figure 2a and 2b). A 2.7 °C increase is an amount of warming that would still threaten the stability of large ice sheets of Greenland and the West Antarctic and otherwise profoundly affect natural and managed systems of the earth as detailed, for example, in the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report.  The Energy-Only policy does not provide any incentive to avoid deforestation and degradation or to reforest. The Energy +Land and No-Biofuel scenarios retain the identical carbon price trajectory as in the Energy-Only policy, but extend pricing to any change in carbon storage in vegetation and soils to approximate a globally successful idealized REDD-like policy, where the Energy+Land allows biofuel production while the No-Biofuel does not. These policies redirect land use away from areas that would result in large losses of carbon and toward land where the new use would be carbon neutral or result in additional carbon storage. The policies cause some cropland to be abandoned and reforested. However, the statistically based downscaling land-use algorithm for locating land-use change includes distance to urban areas as an explanatory variable, and it continues to have a preference for developing cropland where there is more population and greater access to the land. The land-use algorithm also leads to the retention of forest land in more remote areas with less access subject to the requirement that fairly large additions to cropland are needed to meet future demands for food and/or biofuels. The land carbon incentives lead to global mean temperature increase of ∼2.4 °C by 2100 from preindustrial in the No-Biofuel policy, with the CO2 concentration at ∼525 ppmv. The Energy+Land policy reduces the warming further to 2.2 °C by 2100, very near the 2 °C target, and CO2 concentration to ∼490 ppmv (Figure 2a and 2b). 3.2. Biofuel Production and Land Use Change. Biomass plays an important role in supplying liquid fuels needed for transportation, but fossil fuels continue to supply over 80% of primary energy needs in the No-Policy case (Figure 3). In the Energy-Only policy, biofuels contribute more than 40% of the global primary energy by 2100, with more land devoted to biofuels (2.1 × 109 ha) than conventional crops (1.9 × 109 ha). In the Energy-Only scenario, total energy use is reduced from about 1300 EJ in 2100 to 800 EJ due to higher energy costs and energy-efficiency reflecting carbon pricing. The pricing of land carbon in the No-Biofuel and Energy +Land scenarios results in a large, immediate incentive to reforest and limits conversion of natural grassland to pasture but reduces land available for crop and livestock production. The No-Biofuel scenario retains more land for food but has higher petroleum use and thus more CO2 emissions. In the No-Biofuel scenario, 72% of the total energy use of 660 EJ in 2100 comes from fossil fuels. In the Energy+Land scenario, 53% of the 670 EJ of energy is fossil, with biofuels supplying 23% in 2100. Less area is used to produce biofuels (1.4 × 109 ha) and conventional crops (1.2 × 109 ha) in the Energy+Land than in the Energy-Only scenario. Today 1.6 × 109 ha is used for conventional crops. Because biofuels provide an indefinite offset to fuel use, and land used as a carbon sink eventually saturates, we might expect the use of land for biofuel production to dominate reforestation. However, the relative timing of the entry of biomass-based energy is important. With land incentives reforestation occurs immediately, and this investment in reforestation creates irreversibility, as returns from using biomass energy to avoid carbon emissions do not compensate for the large carbon penalty that would be involved with reclearing the land. 3.3. Net Carbon Emissions from Land. Land is a net carbon sink until 2020 for all four scenarios (Figure 2c). In the No-Policy scenario, net land emissions from deforestation begin in 2020 and continue through midcentury (solid line in Figure 2c), with some carbon accumulation in the second half of the century as economic pressures limit access to remaining forests, and carbon storage occurs in woody vegetation and associated soils in response to CO2 fertilization and in agricultural soils in response to nitrogen fertilizer additions. Cumulative net emissions over the 21st century are 21 Pg C. In the Energy-Only scenario (short dashed line in Figure 2c), net land emissions from deforestation occurs during 2020 to 2030, followed by carbon accumulation, especially in soils, in response to fertilization of expanding biofuels crops. By the end of the 21st century, there is a cumulative net gain in land carbon of 36 Pg C. Net carbon emissions display a similar path in the No-Biofuel (dotted line in Figure 2c) and Energy+Land scenarios (long dashed line in Figure 2c). There is a net gain in land carbon storage over the century of 167 Pg C in the No-Biofuel scenario and 178 Pg C in the Energy+Land scenario as a consequence of reforestation and afforestation, with a particularly steep increase in accumulation in the first several decades. Our estimates for the No-Biofuel and Energy+Land scenarios are on the higher end of the range of estimates (0.2− 2.9 Pg C yr−1) projected by other studies for carbon sequestered by forests under a mitigation program during the 21st century,  not surprisingly given the fairly high CO2 price incentives. There are large regional and scenario differences in the sign and magnitude of carbon fluxes between the land and the atmosphere over the century (Figure 4). The largest net losses from the land occur in Africa, −47 Pg C for the No-Policy scenario and −20 Pg C for the Energy-Only scenario. There is a net accumulation of 22 Pg C in Africa for the No-Biofuel scenario and 29 Pg C for the Energy+Land scenario. Latin America shows the second largest cumulative regional net carbon gain of any region, 35 Pg C, in the No-Biofuel scenario, and the largest gain, 45 Pg C, in the Energy+Land scenario (see Table S15 in the Supporting Information for more details).",241.06058

A positive value of NCE represents carbon sequestration by land ecosystems, whereas a negative value means that land ecosystems are losing carbon. Further details of these TEM calculations may be found in the Supporting Information and elsewhere.  To simulate the carbon, nitrogen, and water dynamics of both food and biofuel crops, we use the extant grassland parametrization of TEM in a manner similar to that used by Felzer et al.  for row-crop agriculture. In this study, we assume that both food crops and biofuels are optimally fertilized so that crop productivity is not nitrogen limited. A dynamic cohort approach has been adopted to represent the influence of land-use change on land carbon dynamics in TEM. In this approach, TEM assumes that the terrestrial biosphere is represented by 67,420 grid cells with a spatial resolution of 0.5° latitude × 0.5° longitude and that each grid cell is initially covered by undisturbed potential vegetation, which is represented by an initial cohort that is assigned the entire land area of the grid cell. When a disturbance occurs, such as timber harvest or conversion to croplands (food or biofuels) or pastures, a new cohort is formed, and disturbed land area within the grid cell is then subtracted from the undisturbed potential vegetation cohort and assigned to the new disturbed cohort. Disturbance-related carbon fluxes from an ecosystem are calculated, and the land carbon stocks are adjusted within the new disturbed cohort to account for the initial effect of the disturbance. The TEM is then used to simulate the carbon dynamics of the disturbed cohort and the recovery of land carbon dynamics after abandonment within the context of local environmental conditions. As time progresses in the TEM simulation and more disturbances occur, more cohorts are added to the grid cell. As each disturbance and its effects are tracked separately within TEM, different types of disturbances within a grid cell can be considered simultaneously and allows TEM to consider the impacts of multiple disturbances on land carbon and nitrogen dynamics. The timing, location, and affected area of a disturbance are prescribed by a spatially explicit time-series land cover data set such as that described by Hurtt et al.  or projected by a land-use model. 2.2. MIT Emissions Predictions and Policy Analysis (EPPA) Model. EPPA is a recursive-dynamic multiregional computable general equilibrium (CGE) model of the world economy.  The model is based on the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) database  with the data aggregated into 16 regions and 25 sectors. The EPPA model projects the global economy, land use, and associated anthropogenic emissions into the future through the end of the 21st century at 5-year time steps (see the Supporting Information for more details). In the version of the model used here (EPPA413,14,16), five of these sectors (Crops, Forestry, Livestock, Electric: biomass, Liquid fuel from biomass) require land inputs that have been stratified into five land classescropland, pastureland, managed forest land, natural grasslands, and natural forest.  Land-use change, from one land class to another, depends on the prices of inputs and outputs and changing land productivities. To enable land-use change, each of the five land classes including natural forest and natural grassland has been assigned a region-specific unit price based on the Hurtt et al.  data set, GTAP land-value data,  and the Global Timber Market and Forestry Data Project.  The price ratio of natural forest to managed forest is then applied to the price of pastures to obtain the unit price for natural grasslands. The unit price of each land type is then used to determine changes in the land area required to support future market demand for food, biofuels, and wood products based on associated changes in land value. In the policy analysis for climate mitigation, carbon emission or uptake from land is also a factor to affect land-use change and biofuel production. To price carbon emissions from land or credit carbon uptake on land, we deal with the fundamental dynamic nature of forest carbon accounting in the recursive structure by observing that for a hectare of land where CarbV is the net present value of the change in carbon stock for a hectare of land transition from use i to j at time k, PC,k is the price of carbon at time k, γ is the rate of increase in the price of carbon, r is the discount rate, Carbt is the carbon flux from or to the land at time t, and m is the number of years to an equilibrium stock level of carbon after the land use change. With banking and borrowing of allowances, γ is assumed to equal r so that the annualized rate of return used in the recursive model reduces to where the annualized return is a rental rate, consisting of the sum of the discount rate and δ (where δ = 1/m) is multiplied by the price of carbon in year k and the integrated change in the carbon stock from transition i to j here labeled CarbT. In general, pastureland has the lowest carbon stock, natural grassland the next lowest, then cropland, managed forest, and finally natural forest. We can then impose a system of carbon credits for uptake or require purchase of allowances for transitions that lower carbon stocks. The decision to invest in biofuels is a dynamic problem because the land-use changes needed to produce biomass result in an initial carbon debt that is eventually repaid through repeated harvests that continue to offset fossil fuel use.  [See the section 2.7.3 of the Supporting Information for details on modeling economic dynamics.] We compare the value of emissions from using a hectare of land indefinitely to produce biofuel crops to the value of fossil fuel emissions it would replace by determining the ratio θ where BiofuelEmissionst are the net land carbon emissions associated with the production of biofuels and GasCarb are emissions from gasoline.

To achieve this target, the concurrent deployment of several major climate-change mitigation strategies will be required including those involving changes in land use. Because deforestation accounts for almost 20% of annual global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissionslarger than the entire global transportation sectorreducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) has become a prominent potential mitigation strategy.  Second generation biofuels, cellulosic biofuels, have also been proposed as an important mitigation strategy. Production of these biofuels can potentially occur in a way that both yields large amounts of energy and generates an increase of carbon storage on the land.  Climate-change mitigation strategies that use land will be in competition with new demands for land to produce food and forest products for a wealthier world population that may reach ten billion people by the end of the century. Climate-change mitigation policy, climate, biofuels, land-use changes, and economic activity are highly interactive. Previous investigations have mostly focused on describing these components, or at best, used loosely linked models to focus on one-way effects.  Using a linked modeling system  that simulates global economic activity, climate, atmospheric chemistry, and biogeochemistry of terrestrial ecosystems, we are able to model dynamic interactions and feedbacks of economic activity, climate, climate mitigation policies, land-use change (including the biofuel option) and examine the implications of multiple land pressures for the climate system, energy production, and food prices. 2. MATERIALS AND METHODS The linked modeling system (Figure 1) consists of a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model of the world economy, The Emissions Predictions and Policy Analysis Model, EPPA,  and a Terrestrial Ecosystem Model, TEM.

Greenhouse gas emissions, as projected by EPPA, drive a coupled atmospheric chemistry and climate model  to simulate the future climate that then drives TEM. A set of projected changes in crop, pasture, and forest productivity, simulated in TEM due to changing climate, levels of CO2 and tropospheric ozone, are then fed back to the EPPA model to change yields in the agricultural sectors. Changes in yields, together with changing demand for these products, as driven by population and income growth, lead to reallocations of land among uses, and conversions of land among land types. The regionally aggregated land-use types are downscaled to the 0.5° latitude × 0.5° longitude grid level based on a statistical approach for use in TEM.  The pattern of land use is affected by a number of factors including population and economic growth, changing climate, and atmospheric concentrations of CO2 and tropospheric ozone as they concurrently affect both overall productivity and the regional pattern of production. In addition, climate policy and energy demand affect land use as they drive demand for biofuels. 2.1. The Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (TEM). The TEM is a process-based ecosystem model that uses spatially referenced information on climate, elevation, soils, vegetation, and water availability to estimate monthly vegetation and soil carbon and nitrogen fluxes and pool sizes (see the Supporting Information for more details). TEM has been used to examine patterns of land carbon dynamics across the globe including how they are influenced concurrently by multiple factors such as CO2 fertilization, climate change and variability, land-use change, and ozone pollution.  To determine the influence of environmental factors and land management on terrestrial carbon dynamics, we calculate the net carbon exchange (NCE) between land ecosystems and the atmosphere. The NCE accounts for the carbon gained or lost due to ecosystem metabolism, as represented by net ecosystem production (NEP), the carbon lost during the conversion of natural ecosystems to agriculture (EC) and the carbon lost during the decomposition of agricultural and wood products (EP) as follows NCE = NEP − EC − EP (1)",504.35011

We show that an ambitious global Energy-Only climate policy that includes biofuels would likely not achieve the 2 °C target. A thought-experiment where the world ideally prices land carbon fluxes combined with biofuels (Energy+Land policy) gets the world much closer. Land could become a large net carbon sink of about 178 Pg C over the 21st century with price incentives in the Energy+Land scenario. With land carbon pricing but without biofuels (a No-Biofuel scenario) the carbon sink is nearly identical to the case with biofuels, but emissions from energy are somewhat higher, thereby results in more warming. Absent such incentives, land is either a much smaller net carbon sink (+37 Pg C − Energy-Only policy) or a net source (−21 Pg C − No-Policy). The significant trade-off with this integrated land-use approach is that prices for agricultural products rise substantially because of mitigation costs borne by the sector and higher land prices.

In contrast, the technology assumptions for CCS were judged to be realistic, suggesting that CCS assumptions do not confront its physical or technical limits in the same way as those for the use of biomass do. The risk that bioenergy production offsets some ofthe total negative emissions potential of the BECCS system through direct and indirect land use change emerged as a key concern. While these concerns equally apply to model-led emission reductions from biomass energy use alone, an issue here is whether that would compromise the net negativity assumed within a BECCS system. Without robust regulatory frameworks to guard against this risk, the scale ofremoval ofcarbon dioxide achieved through BECCS in future scenarios may be significantly overestimated. The majority of our experts viewed the use of negative emissions in IAM scenarios as driven by the constraint to stay within cumulative carbon budgets consistent with a 2 °C target. The implication of an unrealistically ambitious reliance on BECCS in scenarios is that an overspend of the cumulative carbon budgets in the near term will result in the failure to limit temperature rise to below 2 °C, should the realisation of BECCS at the assumed scale not be achieved. Policy discourses typically assume that BECCS will be driven by carbon markets or other fiscal incentives, but other equally important governance and policy structures, such as binding global emission reduction agreements, and accounting and monitoring frameworks are implicitly assumed in models. Given these challenges, combined with a current lack ofprogress in commercial rollout ofCCS technologies and limited experience of implementing full chain BECCS systems, it is apparent that the necessary requirements for embarking on a negative emissions pathway are not in place. Although some IAM runs do present scenarios compatible with 2 °C without BECCS (e.g. Luderer et al 2013), the modelling widely suggests that keeping climate change well below two degrees may not be feasible without BECCS, even with ambitious emission reductions in all sectors (Rogelj et al 2013, van Vuuren et al 2013, Krey et al 2014, Anderson 2015b). One of the primary purposes of this paper was to open up the debate to deliver a better understanding of the relationship between assumptions relating to BECCS and the feasibility of reaching the 2 °C target. While acknowledging that there will always be limitations to the accuracy oflarge integrated models such as IAMs, the critical nature of how negative emissions from BECCS technologies is represented and the inherent uncertainties identified here warrant further attention. The ultimate aim is thus to not only improve the representation of BECCS within the models but also to clarify the basis of evidence underpinning the policy discourse relating to two degrees. Here we have identified assumptions located within a ‘danger zone’; future work would seek to improve their pedigree and further unpack the boundaries and feasibilities of these aspects of BECCS. This could be achieved by parallel approaches of detailed sensitivity analyses to formally identify critical constraints which drive the model results, alongside a thorough socio-techno-economic analysis of BECCS supply chains, including an exploration of possible regulatory and governance frameworks that accommodate the complexities and challenges of negative emissions and in particular BECCS. So while our research shows that there are clearly questions relating to the potential for BECCS to deliver global net negative emissions, there is also a strong imperative to better understand the conditions for and consequences of pursuing the technology.",434.69023

A nominal mean was calculated for the ordinal data and waste residues (Azar et al 2013, van Vuuren et al 2013). The experts also noted novel approaches, such as bioengineering and/or algal sources could have a significant impact (Walsh et al 2015). The proportion of total energy supply provided by bioenergy scored low for expediency (being malleable to context) and plausibility in particular (figure 2(3)), with concerns expressed about scale up timescales and the prospects for adequate policy measures to enable it. It is worth noting that, as with the CCS assumptions, concerns relating to the bioenergy assumptions apply regardless ofwhether or not the assumed levels ofbiomass are destined to be used as part ofa BECCS system to deliver negative emissions. The results imply that the CCS components of the BECCS scenarios are better constrained (figure 1) and that there are presumed to be no significant technical barriers to delivering CCS, although the geographical heterogeneity of the quality of storage data on a global scale was noted (IPCC 2005); individual scores for these assumptions are shown in figures 2(4) and (5). Experts considered that technology uptake, which should be based on precedented technology uptake rates, depend instead on the rate at which storage can be identified and utilised and at which infrastructure, governance and policy frameworks can be put in place. Experts suggested that the speed ofadoption will affect the cost of deployment and may influence social acceptance and assumptions about societal responses. The workshop highlighted that challenges to CCS delivery at large scale remain around social acceptability and policy frameworks, as reflected by the poorer performance of these assumptions across the criteria (figures 1(7) and (8)). BECCS is predicated on the existence of a CCS infrastructure, which is in turn dependent on policy and institutional support, which are by no means assured (Scott et al 2013, Lomax et al 2015) and are much more challenging to parameterise than the technical aspects of establishing the technology. The experts considered policy framework assumptions, such as fiscal carbon incentives, to be influential on the results (figure 2(7)), highlighting concerns about uncertainties due to effectiveness of markets, complexity of interactions with land use policy and feedbacks on land availability, and support for CCS infrastructure and technology transfer. IAM scenarios typically assume robust policy frameworks deliver global participation and collaboration in climate mitigation actions (van Vuuren and Riahi 2011). Experts within the cross-cutting group identified concerns over social tolerance for bioenergy, especially at such a large scale and given its interconnected pressures on food production and water availability, and localised social tolerance concerns relating to CCS storage sites (L’Orange Seigo et al 2014, Halder et al 2015, Radics et al 2015); these concerns for social acceptability across the BECCS system are reflected in low scores shown in figure 2(8). In both sub- and whole group discussions, experts questioned the assumed amount ofnegative emissions a BECCS system would deliver when considering the whole lifecycle impact. They judged the main sources ofuncertainty to lie within the bioenergy contribution to net negative emissions, including direct and indirect land use change effects on carbon, nutrients and water, and robust regulatory frameworks to ensure best practice (Tilman et al 2009). Given the dependence on BECCS in IAM scenarios to remove large amounts of CO2 from the atmosphere (Fuss et al 2014), it was stressed that there is a requirement for close monitoring and robust regulatory frameworks to ensure the BECCS supply chain is genuinely net negative across its whole lifecycle. In the whole group discussions, the scale and timescale at which BECCS is assumed to be deployed in the models was seen by the experts as being extremely ambitious and, to a great extent, a product of working within the constraints of a 2 °C target. Other factors noted during the workshop were the diverse spatial and regional heterogeneity embedded within the assumptions underpinning global net negative emissions, including land use policy, political economies, and networks of multiple actors. Furthermore, the influence of future climate change on the potential for negative emissions could be significant and impact on many elements of the BECCS supply chain, with the potential for this situation to be exacerbated if temperature rises are greater than anticipated, i.e. a high climate sensitivity. The workshop revealed that the complexity of systems involved in BECCS approaches should not be underestimated and are characteristic across both the component systems (bioenergy and CCS) as well as the integration oftechnologies and their different actor networks and supply chains. Representing a more modest realisation of BECCS might be more realistic and consequently better represent BECCS as a feasible climate change mitigation option. (Kloprogge et al 2011). Detailed breakdown of the scoring of criteria are presented in figure 2. Figures 1 and 2 provide a comparative illustration of participants’ views on the quality ofthe selected assumptions and identify those which should be prioritised for further consideration, i.e. those having a strong influence on the model results and high uncertainty (‘danger zone’) (figure 1). We use the results of the scoring (figures 1 and 2) and the associated deliberation to summarise concerns that emerged, supported by additional evidence from the wider literature. Seven of the ten assumptions fall within a ‘danger zone’, with a high influence on results but low pedigree, including all the bioenergy and cross-cutting assumptions (figure 1). Figure 2 presents individual scores for assumptions on radar plots, in which lines on the plot represent individuals’ scores against each criterion; plots show variation in the scoring by individual experts. The experts considered all three of the bioenergy assumptions to be strongly interconnected and influenced by uncertain impacts such as future socio-eco-nomic trends and the effects of climate change on systems, such as food production, water resources, biodiversity, and land use change (van Vuuren et al 2009, Bonsch et al 2014, Slade et al 2014). Land availability is highly interdependent upon future crop yields and focuses on the fraction (usually up to half) of bioenergy produced by dedicated energy crops; the remaining bioenergy is assumed to come from forestry",434.68843

The methodology was conducted in two stages: (i) a literature review to identify key assumptions (Gough and Vaughan 2015) followed by (ii) an expert elicitation exercise designed to explore the underlying quality of the assumptions in question in a systematic and structured way. The expert elicitation process bought together experts from academia, business, policy, and NGOs to share knowledge and understanding in a way that can benefit from published and unpublished wisdom of those experts (Knol et al 2010). The one day workshop involved 18 experts with relevant knowledge in areas including CCS, bioenergy, policy, climate, earth systems, and modelling (supplementary data table 2). All bar one of the experts represented UK institutions, the exception being an academic from the Netherlands. While recognising that the small number of participants drawn from a narrow geographical area introduces a certain bias to the results, the diversity ofexpertise and knowledge that the participants bring to this qualitative assessment is nevertheless considered to provide a useful assessment of uncertainty as a complement to more formal quantitative approaches to uncertainty analysis. Furthermore, this number of participants is at the upper end of workshop sizes in previous applications of the methodology (van der Sluijs etal 2005, de Jong et al 2012). Nine key assumptions (table 1) were selected by the authors from 20 identified in the literature review (supplementary data table 1) (Gough and Vaughan 2015); these were considered to be the critical assumptions and parameters that govern either the contribution that BECCS makes to final carbon budgets in the IAMs (in terms of magnitude or timescales of CO2 removal) or the feasibility of establishing BECCS at the assumed scales. Experts were split into three groups according to expertise and evaluated assumptions related to: bioenergy including (1) available land area, (2) future yield, and (3) proportion ofenergy; CCS including (4) storage capacity, (5) technology uptake, and (6) capture rate; cross-cutting issues including (7) policy framework, (8) social acceptability, and (9) net negative emissions (table 1). Although the present analysis is explicitly interested in how these assumptions come together in the way that BECCS is represented in IAMs, note that the assumptions identified in the bioenergy and CCS groups are not specific to BECCS applications er se, but are equally relevant when considering how those technologies are modelled as separate technologies. Groups were given the opportunity to suggest additional assumptions, the CCS group chose to score (10) ‘How negative is BECCS?’ (table 1); thus ten assumptions were scored in total. Experts individually scored each assumption allocated to their group against five criteria, these were: influence on results, agreement amongst peers, availability of data or information, plausibility, expediency (table 2). These criteria were selected by the authors as being the most appropriate for the analysis and were chosen to describe different types of uncertainty (Kloprogge et al 2011). Criteria were scored between 0 (very low) and 4 (high level of confidence) with guidance on how the scores should be interpreted with respect to each of the criteria. The number of participants scoring any one assumption ranged from 4 to 6 depending on group size and non-completion ofscore cards. A final session was designed to allow a more open discussion on the issues relating to the deployment ofBECCS (see supplementary data).",434.127

In the context of integrated assessment modelling, BECCS enables mitigation costs to be reduced; more ambitious targets to become feasible (Rogelj et al 2015); or a delay in the year of peak emissions and overspending of the cumulative carbon budget in the near term (‘buying time’) (van Vuuren et al 2007). In light ofArticle 2 ofthe UNFCCC Paris Agreement which aims to ‘Hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels’ (United Nations 2015), closer scrutiny of the feasibility of BECCS becomes increasingly pertinent (Anderson 2015a). BECCS achieves negative emissions if the CO2 produced during combustion of biomass energy is captured and stored indefinitely in geological formations, since CO2 is absorbed from the atmosphere during the growth cycle of biomass feedstocks (Obersteiner et al 2001, Kemper 2015, Smith et al 2015a). BECCS is used in 101 of the 116 (86%) IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) scenarios associated with limiting climate change to below 2 °C (Fuss et al 2014). Although BECCS is the most widely used in the IAMs, other approaches for removing carbon dioxide have been proposed, including afforestation which is also represented in IAM scenarios (Vaughan and Lenton 2011, Fuss et al 2014). The majority ofthe scenarios assume BECCS is deployed from 2020 onwards, with the rate of CO2 removal in 2050 ranging from 2 to 10 GtCO2 yr−1, reaching global net negative emissions by 2070 at a maximum rate of 20 GtCO2 yr−1 (equivalent to half of present day fossil fuel emissions) (ibid). Wiltshire et al (2015) found a median value of around 166 GtC cumulatively removed (13.5 GtCO2/ yr) by 2100 using BECCS in the IPCC scenarios associated with limiting climate change to below 2 °C. The feasibility of this dependence on BECCS must be considered in the context of the interconnected and interdependent issues of food production and energy provision for a growing population and their attendant environmental impacts. The use ofsignificant amounts of both biomass energy and CCS feature across IPCC mitigation scenarios (Clarke etal 2014) and we note that the issues associated with the large scale supply of biomass energy are not dependent on its deployment as part of a BECCS system and, indeed, are not solely restricted to 2 °C scenarios. Here we seek to open up the feasibility debate by unpacking some of the issues that govern the potential role ofBECCS in climate change mitigation. We utilise an expert elicitation method designed to investigate the quality of IAM assumptions in a systematic and structured way (de Jong et al 2012). The assumptions assessed here were drawn from the literature where they are either explicitly described, referred to but not quantified, or implicit. Improving the transparency of assumptions would support the ability of model users and wider policy and academic communities to better understand and respond to conclusions drawn from model outputs (Smith et al 2015b), in terms of both establishing their role in defining the policy landscape and improving the credibility ofmodel results (Saltelli and Funtowicz 2014).",433.78674

All investment costs are the regionally adjusted by a cost multiplier. For the coal and gas power plants with CCS the price premium for the carbon capture is applied on top of the investment cost of the model's corresponding baseline technology without CCS.

In addition, given that different metrics might be of interest to policy makers, depending on the focus of the policy under consideration, we explore sensitivity of different types of output of Integrated Assessment Models, rather than concentrating on the sole objective function (or policy cost metric). This exercise is also extremely important from the viewpoint of modelers, who can better understand what is driving the results of their complex models and, as a consequence, focus their modeling and calibration efforts where it is more crucial in terms of model responses.",251.769

For instance, the market penetration of renewables in WITCH is less sensitive to the cost, because of strictly binding constraint on grid-integration of intermittent renewables (the constraint on the flexibility of the power generation fleet mentioned early). Similarly, nuclear power generation is constrained in WITCH for a variety of reasons, as the built in flexibility constraint. As we have already mentioned, the greater presence of renewables requires more flexibility in the mix, which is not conveniently provided by nuclear power plants. Hence, instances when both solar and nuclear technologies realization are low cost are not necessarily particularly favorable.",251.76404

This shows, from a different angle, that GCAM results are more sensitive to technology performance than those of WITCH. At the lowest cost and highest efficiency, GCAM results indicate that renewable and nuclear energies can take up to 60% and 75% of the world's electricity supply in 2090, respectively. In comparison, WITCH results show smaller variance. For instance, at the lowest solar costs considered, the renewables’ share of electricity does not exceed 20%, while nuclear energy does not take more than 60% of the power production mix. These differences bring forward the fundamental structural differences in the model architecture. Given sufficiently low prices, GCAM's flexible structure allows solar, nuclear, or CCS energy to saturate the electricity market. For instance, at $385/kW capital cost of nuclear energy, GCAM allows most electricity markets to be dominated by nuclear energy within a few decades. Conversely, at the very unlikely extreme of $5727/ kW there are virtually no new nuclear plants being built in the future. Such built-in flexibility of the architecture results in a lower cost of abatement, as well as a large sensitivity to either extremes of the technology costs.",251.763986

The first and most straightforward output to study is the cost of CO2 abatement policy as a share of baseline GDP. Policy costs are measured in slightly different ways in different models (for MARKAL_US only the price of carbon is available and will be discussed below). In WITCH policy costs are measured as the difference in global consumption in the policy case versus the baseline. In GCAM, as GDP is exogenous and independent of the climate policy, the policy cost is measured in the reduction of social surplus, i.e. the area under the marginal abatement cost curve. In both cases costs are discounted at 5% and reported as share of GDP. Although these two metrics are not entirely comparable, as a matter of fact they are typically used for relative effort comparisons across models (see for example Clarke et al. (2009)). In particular here, as we are interested in the relative effect of each technology performance rather than on the estimates of climate policy costs per se, it seems appropriate to compare these two metrics.

Within this single region as well, the cost of nuclear energy is again the main player for WITCH. For MARKAL_US, an effect is registered for nuclear energy at the extremes of its variation ranges. However, MARKAL_US, while producing an emission variation range comparable to that of the WITCH model for the US (see Fig. 1, right hand side panel), displays a very low sensitivity to individual changes in technology costs and efficiency values. The almost horizontal shape of the first order effects and the very overlapped curves practically indicate that the model inputs play the effects of numerical noise, when considered individually. Indeed, the MARKAL_US baseline includes a number of assumptions and policies, in the form of additional constraints, that contribute to a less clear sensitivity to technology costs and efficiency levels when considered as individual determinants of the model output. Conversely, these constraints increase the interaction effects, as confirmed shortly when considering the sensitivity measures in Table 2. Let us describe in detail what these constraints are. First of all, the inclusion of state level renewable portfolio standards (RPS) and wind generation tax credits in MARKAL_US lead to a higher level of renewable generation already by 2020, and independently on the technological performance realization. Additionally, the assumed ability to apply for a second 20-year life extension for nuclear power plants and the assumption that fossil steam plants do not have fixed retirement schedules (instead the retirements are determined endogenously) also limits the potential market for new technologies. Furthermore, the inclusion of the renewable fuel standard (RFS), as legislated by the Energy Independence and Security act of 2007, requires 36 billion U.S. gallons of biofuels by 2022. Hence, while biomass-based fuels gain market share versus petroleum-based fuels in MARKAL_US, biomass-based power generation is relatively disadvantaged by other fuels in the electric generation market in MARKAL_US.",251.1225

This type of analysis casts light on the sign of change setting discussed in the methods section. The lines in Fig. 2 are the first order effects of the functional ANOVA expansion of g(x) obtained through numerical interpolation. These lines represent the expected variation of output y (in this case cumulative emissions) as a function of each individual model input. The top panels in Fig. 2 show that the capital cost of nuclear energy is the factor that, when varying in the assigned range, influences the output of both GCAM and WITCH the most. In particular, WITCH reacts almost linearly to changes in the capital cost of nuclear energy, while the reaction in GCAM is non-linear, with a higher rate of change in the low-nuclear energy cost region. As before, the smaller extent of the reaction in WITCH can be explained by the model structure itself which is based on constant elasticity of substitution nested functions to mimic the energy sector (a detailed description of each of the three models is provided in the Appendix). Such a structure is inherently less flexible and implies slower pace of technological shifts than that of models, as for example the GCAM model, that assume other functional relations among technologies, as for example linear aggregation across technologies (see Kriegler et al. (2015) for a comparative analysis and classification of alternative model types). In addition, WITCH includes a constraint on the flexibility of the energy sector technological mix that penalizes excessive penetration of low flexibility technologies (i.e. renewables as well as base load technologies as for example nuclear) versus high flexibility ones (i.e. gas power plants) (Sullivan et al., 2013). A further potential difference between the WITCH and GCAM models is in the way nuclear waste management cost are treated (in WITCH nuclear waste management costs increase with the world cumulated capacity of nuclear capital installed to mimic some sort of saturation effect). However, as the objective of the analysis is to look deeply into model structures and how they might affect models' reactions to input parameter variations, assumptions about nuclear waste management costs were harmonization across the two models.",252.255576

Conversely, the WITCH model is much less sensitive to cost and efficiency variations considered in this exercise and, in average, emissions grow more by the end of the century, even under the most optimistic realization of parameters. This difference in the response to energy costs realization, as will be unpacked even more in later discussions, mainly hinges on the structural setup differences between the WITCH model, that overall entails slower and more costly technological adoption and evolution, and the GCAM model. Looking at the right hand panel of Fig. 1 we can immediately notice the difference between WITCH and MARKAL_US: though the magnitude of the variation is roughly the same, the timing is different.

Variance-based sensitivity measures (second row in Table 2) quantify the separation as expected variance reduction. In particular, the sensitivity measure ηi is Pearson's correlation ratio (Lewandowski et al., 2007; Pearson, 1905). Thus, according to ηi the most important model input is the one that, when fixed, reduces the model output variance the most. Density-based importance measures (third row in Table 2), identify the most important model input as the one that shifts the model output density the most (Borgonovo, 2007). The CDF-based sensitivity measure in the last row of Table 2 quantifies the influence of model input Xi through the Kuiper distance on cumulative distribution functions [see Tygert (2010) for properties of the Kuiper metrics and Baucells and Borgonovo (2013) for properties of the sensitivity measure in the fourth row of Table 2]. It should be noted that all these sensitivity measures are normalized between zero and unity. The rationale for using a combination of sensitivity measures is as follows. Each sensitivity measure considers a different property of the model output distribution. Thus, if a model input is deemed irrelevant by all the measures, then we can have greater confidence that its influence is low. Second, each sensitivity measure has limitations. For instance, in using variance based sensitivity measures one is exposed to the risk of deeming a model input uninfluential when, indeed, Y is dependent on it (see the example in (Plischke et al., 2013)). Conversely, density and CDF-based sensitivity measures are null if and only if Y is independent of Xi, avoiding such risk. 2.4.2. Evaluation of sign of change As for sign of change, we rely on the first order effects of the functional ANOVA expansion of the model output. The rationale is explained in (Anderson et al., 2014), to which we refer for further details and mathematical aspects. We limit ourselves here to the following observations on the underlying intuition. Assuming that the multivariate mapping as in Eq. (1) is integrable, we can expand it in the form where the terms in Eq. (3) have the following meaning. g0 is the mean value of y. gi(xi)is individual effect of xi, namely, the expected behavior of g as a function of xi alone. In the formulae, gi(xi) = E[g(x)|Xi = xi] − g0 = ∫… ∫g(x) s=∏n1,s≠i dFs − g0 (4) that is, gi(xi) is the conditional expectation of g given xi, from which the mean value of g is subtracted. Note that in Eq. (4) g is integrated over all variables but xi. The second order terms gi,j(xi, xj) account for the residual effects of the interactions of the corresponding model inputs, and so on. These terms are obtained through conditional expectations followed by proper orthogonalization, see Rabitz and Aliş (1999). By determining sign of change, we mean a generalization of the comparative statics question of Samuelson (1947): it is hoped to formulate qualitative restrictions on slopes, curvatures, etc. That is, we are interested in studying whether, on average, the variation in a model input leads to an increase or decrease in the model output. The literature has ascertained that, under uncertainty, this answer can be gained by considering the first order effects of the functional ANOVA expansion. In fact, it is proven in Beccacece and Borgonovo (2011) that these effects retain the monotonicity of the original input–output mapping. To clarify, if g is increasing in xi, then gi(xi) is increasing, see Anderson et al. (2014) for further details.",251.08368

In particular, models run with emissions caps in line with scenarios imposing a radiative forcing of 2.6 and 4.5 W/m2 by 2100.

The remainder of 20% cost reduction occurs after 2030).

The recent Fifth Assessment report of the IPCC WG III (IPCC, 2014) stresses the relevance of assumptions concerning the availability and costs of future technologies in shaping the range of policy costs. This has long been recognized within the Integrated Assessment Modeling (IAM) community (Edmonds et al., 2012), and the quantitative analysis of the future availability/cost of carbon-free and low-carbon technologies has been at the center of a growing literature. The most commonly adopted approach relies on the use of an IAM and the running of climate-constrained scenarios with and without the availability of key energy technologies, in order to assess the increase in climate mitigation costs/carbon prices under each alternative. A few studies have comprehensively analyzed the impact of advances in future energy technologies on the cost of greenhouse gas mitigation by means of sensitivity analysis and using an individual model (McJeon et al., 2011; Lemoine and McJeon, 2013; Rogelj et al., 2012, Anadón et al., 2014.). In parallel to these pioneering works, a set of modeling comparison analyses has been performed. We recall the Energy Modeling Forum (EMF) 27 (Kriegler et al., 2014) and the Assessment of Climate Change Mitigation Pathways and Evaluation of the Robustness of Mitigation Cost Estimates (AMPERE) Project (Riahi et al., 2015). The latter studies are characterized by selected sensitivity analyses to extreme technology realizations and a focus on robust results across models. The findings that emerged from these and other studies, as summarized in the IPCC latest assessment report are that: (a) Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) technologies, which can be used to generate negative emissions, are the most critical class of technologies, as they allow a modification in the time path of the emissions constraint (the possibility of negative emissions by the end of the century would allow post-poning peak emissions later in the century); (b) bioenergy coupled with CCS would have a central role, and the unavailability of either component of this technology would result in an increase in policy costs between 18% and 300%, depending on the stringency of the climate scenario analyzed and whether the limitation of technology availability concerns bioenergy or CCS. Assumptions about the availability of other low-carbon energy technologies also matter (for example, the availability of low-cost renewables, CCS alone, and nuclear power), although their impact on mitigation costs are typically less pronounced. In this study, by building on this existing knowledge, we use a different approach to evaluate the extent to which uncertainty about future technology costs in key energy technologies trans-lates to different model outcomes. Instead of switching on and off one technology at a time (or in combination) in various models, we explore the space of future technological costs and other parameters, parameterized by using a set of expert elicitation surveys. In particular, we take stock of extensive efforts that have been carried out independently by researchers at UMass Amherst, Harvard, and FEEM. In particular, we take stock of extensive efforts that have been carried out independently by researchers at UMass Amherst (Baker and Keisler, 2011; Baker et al., 2009b; Baker et al., 2009a; Baker et al., 2008; Harvard (Anadon et al., 2011; Anadon et al., 2012; Anadón et al., 2014a; Chan et al., 2011); and FEEM Bosetti et al., 2012; Catenacci et al., 2013; Fiorese et al., 2013). Each of these groups collected the opinions of leading experts from the academic world, the private sector, and international institutions on the probabilistic distribution of future costs of the most promising clean energy technologies, conditionally to different levels of R&D efforts. The technologies include liquid biofuels, electricity from biomass, carbon capture (CCS), nuclear power, and solar photovoltaic (PV) power. All surveys were carried out by means of structured protocols aiming at minimizing potential biases and overconfidence that can characterized experts elicitations (Morgan, 2014). Although different groups carried out surveys covering the same set of technologies, each group worked independently, and thus asked questions using different formats, looking at different endpoints and cost metrics. Therefore, the effort of harmonizing the data across surveys has represented a complex endeavor which is fully described in Baker et al. (2015a). The resulting estimates span a wide array of uncertainties including those that might be related to different methodology employed to collect the data from experts.",251.1333

The dark grey box on the left side represents total CO2 emissions from fossil fuels, industry and land-use from 1920 to 2009 [17,20,21].

Furthermore, IMAGE and IMACLIM are not considered since the 450-FullTech-HST scenario was found infeasible in both models. See Ref. [5] for discussion of the infeasibility concept. 11 Note that the models with the largest net emissions during the 2030–2050 period (and thus those with the largest overshoots) are also the models that have the greatest potential for net negative emissions in the latter half of the century (Fig. 6 and Fig. A1). 12 There is very little difference between the emissions trajectories for the 450-FullTech-OPT and 450-FullTech-HST scenarios in GCAM (see footnote 4).

Institutional settings have to be designed so that biomass production will not conflict with food production or with conservation of nature and sustainability.

This technological flexibility is to some extent lost in the low stabilization scenario where some key technologies become indispensable for reaching the policy target. Renewables (solar, hydro, wind), CCS and biomass on the one hand, and energy efficiencies and other demand-side regulatory measures on the other, play a very important part in reaching this low stabilization level. Concerning technology options, the models investigated show a very similar picture leading to robust conclusions about the ranking of the mitigation options in terms of costs. The use of biomass, other renewables and CCS are the most important technology options. Without them the low stabilization at 400ppm CO2 eq is not attainable at all. • The assumed biomass potential determines to a large extent the mitigation costs, in addition to having a decisive influence on the energy mix. The most critical point is that in some models the use of biomass competes with the other renewable sources: the more biomass that is available (and used), the lower the amount of other renewables needed in the energy mix. In other words, by setting a restriction on biomass use, the innovation rate in the other renewables is accelerated, although the overall costs may increase. With greater biomass use, potential conflicts with food production, biodiversity conservation, water availability, and additional emissions associated with large-scale energy-crop production also have to be considered. • The CCS potential also has an influence on the feasibility of low stabilization and the resulting mitigation costs. Without any CCS, low stabilization is not possible and with a level of CCS that is low but sufficient to meet the low stabilization target, costs are still very high. Storage capacity of 120 GtC turns out to be such a level. • Nuclear power does not play an important additional role in mitigation scenarios in any of the models beyond the role it plays in their baselines where nuclear energy is attractive in most models; fixing nuclear power to its baseline values leads only to a marginal increase in costs. With a phase out of nuclear, however, costs do increase. However, this is less than with an economically severely limited CCS potential. Fast breeder reactors overcome resource depletion challenges of nuclear energy, and mitigation costs decrease slightly. However, the fraction of nuclear power in the energy mix increases substantially.",324.49296

The abatement costs generated by TIMER and POLES are of a similar order of magnitude. The uncertainties and costs grow at an increasing rate with lower stabilization targets, but the costs for all scenarios reported here are in the lower to medium range compared to the values given in the IPCC AR4. E3MG reports clearly different results concerning the mitigation costs. In this model, gains due to mitigation of up to 2.1% can be observed for all stabilization pathways. Furthermore, such economic gains are expected to increase with lower stabilization targets. The reason lies in the different model set-up of E3MG, which does not assume market clearing, or equilibrium and full employment of resources in the baseline. The climate policies partly solve the inefficiencies in the baseline but it remains disputable whether these gains can be attributed to climate policy alone.",342.03992

The analysis compared three different stabilization scenarios, ranging from 550ppm and 450ppm to 400ppm CO2 eq, to a business-as-usual (baseline) scenario where no political action is taken to mitigate climate change. We investigated in detail the technological feasibility of a low stabilization scenario of 400ppm CO2 eq under various constraints and compared this scenario with the other less ambitious stabilization targets in terms of mitigation costs, reduction strategies and the energy mix. The focus was on gauging the option values of different technologies and estimating the competitive potential of certain technologies/ resources, i.e., the biomass potential or the cost-effective storage potential under carbon capture and storage (CCS). The models compared in this exercise are quite different in their basic modeling approach and their assumptions about the availability of certain technologies. Nevertheless, some results appear robust across models. We showed that low stabilization of CO2 emissions is found to be achievable, at moderate costs, in all models used if the full suite of technologies is available, all regions participate in emission reduction and effective policy instruments are applied. The model comparison identifies a number of different pathways by which a low stabilization target of 400 ppm CO2 eq for atmospheric greenhouse gas emissions can be achieved by 2100. However, stricter mitigation targets bring greater dependence on selected technologies, such as CCS and biomass. This implies some loss of flexibility in the choice of technologies to achieve the more ambitious climate protection targets. However, without the availability of CCS or the considerable extension of renewables, the most ambitious mitigation pathway is not feasible.",324.45891

This is partly due to the fact that nuclear energy is already incorporated in the baseline scenario but is actually less attractive in the mitigation case for some models (POLES and MERGE, see Figure 14). The reliance on nuclear power as an “interim-technology” decreases after the middle of this century as a result of depletion of uranium (represented in MERGE and REMIND). Keeping the use of nuclear power at baseline leads to more coal-based power generation coupled with CCS or reduced energy use. Nuclear power becomes an important mitigation option only when the biomass potential is assumed to be low. When no investments are made in nuclear power after the year 2000 (i. e., assuming an extreme nuclear phase-out scenario), costs increase moderately in the 550ppm scenario but by up to 0.7 percentage points under low stabilization. Two models explore the option of introducing a fast breeder. With it costs can be reduced from 2.5% to 1.9% for MERGE and hardly at all for REMIND compared to the standard scenario without the fast breeder option. While reducing mitigation costs, the fast breeder may increase the risk of nuclear proliferation. Moreover, costs for the storage of nuclear waste are not included in any of the models. Including them would make the nuclear option less attractive in all scenarios including the baseline.",324.44002

A limited CCS potential (ccsmin) achieves the target but also raises costs. In MERGE, the costs increase to 3.6%, in REMIND to 2% of GDP. In POLES the ccsmin scenario cannot be run due to code constraints. The CO2 abatement attributable to CCS compared to total emission reductions is depicted in Figure 13. With a more stringent target, the use of CCS increases only slightly for MERGE and REMIND while remaining constant for POLES and TIMER even though the last three models place no limits on the CCS potential, and the potential in MERGE is not fully used. This implies that after a certain point the marginal costs for CCS become uncompetitive with other abatement options so a (near-)constant amount of CCS is used, regardless of the stabilization target. Overall, the amount of CO2 that is captured with CCS ranges from 275 GtC in POLES to 520 GtC in TIMER for the low stabilization case. In the scenario with a reduced CCS potential, capturing about 120 GtC is sufficient to reach the low stabilization goal. It is important to note that for MERGE and POLES a saturation of the captured CO2 is observed by 2050. In TIMER and REMIND captured CO2 increases until 2080 and then declines, not limited by storage potential, but because the emissions for CCS from coal decline. CCS technologies in E3MG penetrate the market only to a limited extent due mostly to their high costs relative to other low carbon technologies. E3MG shows how it is possible to do without CCS through deep and early emission cuts compatible with maintaining positive emissions. CCS is not then as important as when assuming pathways with negative emissions. The E3MG model aside, stabilizing GHG emissions with only limited or no CCS either precludes reaching an ambitious climate protection target or raises the costs of such an achievement considerably. Costs are holding back the use of CCS rather than its technical potential. A robust conclusion from all models is that a potential between 120 and 500 GtC is required to achieve low stabilization targets. This is below the assumed technical capacity of 545 GtC in geological storage indicated by the IPCC (Metz et al. 2005). Further, it is important to note that with the stricter stabilization target, the use of CCS in combination with biomass rather than coal becomes increasingly important (see Figure 13). This could mean that part of the storage potential should be reserved for use with biomass as only this option facilitates removal of CO2 from the atmosphere.",324.4226

Thus for biomass production, conflicts with other types of land use, in particular food production and biodiversity protection, as well as the question of whether a given biomass harvest can be sustained, have not been investigated. Cost effects of higher land prices due to increased demand have so far not been accounted for in the models. Furthermore, zero emissions are attributed to bio-energy use, thus neglecting emissions from direct and indirect land-use changes and the biomass production process itself. Certain types of land-use changes, such as converting wetlands or clearing tropical forests, lead to increased greenhouse gas emissions rather than emission reductions. Neglecting these emissions not only hides possible additional climate damage, but also yields an overly optimistic assessment of the economic potential of biomass in scenarios including carbon pricing. All these points are crucial for the assessment of low stabilization scenarios. Indeed it could turn out that the costs of low stabilization, incorporating all these factors, would be at the upper end of the percentages shown in Figure 11. To complete the analysis of biomass use, some of these issues will be assessed in van Vuuren et al. (2010, this Issue). The norenew scenario is implemented differently by the models. In REMIND the investments into solar, wind and hydro and additionally the investments into bioenergy are fixed to baseline values. This leads to much higher costs in the 550ppm scenario and an infeasibity for the 400ppm scenario. As the amount of biomass is quite high in the baseline in REMIND, this constraint does not cause the infeasibility of the norenew scenario in case of low stabilization. The limiting factor is that no investments into bioenergy use combined with CCS, being an important option in REMIND, are allowed in this scenario. Fixing only solar, wind and hydro to baseline values means the 400ppm scenario can be achieved at slightly increased costs (Leimbach et al., 2010, this Issue) as these renewables are already well represented in the baseline (see Figure 4). Therefore, the norenew scenario in REMIND mainly shows the effect of the unavailabilty of bioenergy in combination with CCS. In POLES the total amount of biomass rather than the investments, are fixed to baseline, so that the biomass plus CCS option is available. This leads to just a slight increase of the costs for the 550ppm scenario, although the low stabilization target cannot be achieved as a much higher amount of biomass with CCS is needed (see Figure 4). In both the REMIND and POLES models, nuclear energy is more important in the norenew scenario than in the case where all options are available. In MERGE, only the investments into solar, wind and hydro are fixed to baseline values; investments into bioenergy are not fixed. This should give the model more flexibility to reach the target, but in the case of the 550ppm scenario, the costs increased more than in the two other models and the 400ppm target is not achievable. This is because the amount of renewable energy is very low in the baseline (see Figure 4). This also means that the H2 production directly from solar thermal (see Magné et al. 2010, this Issue), being important in MERGE, is not an option and is what prevents the 400ppm target being achieved. In the 550ppm scenario this limit can be absorbed by costly demand reductions and an increasing use of bioenergy in combination with CCS.",342.39753

The models apply different technologies for this option. In REMIND biomass can be used with the biomass-to-liquid option, for combined heat and power, as well as for H2 production (see Table 2). In the baseline and the 550ppm scenario, the production of biomass-to-liquid is the main option for biomass use to supply the transport sector (cf. in this Issue, Leimbach et al., 2010; van Vuuren et al., 2010). Under low stabilization, especially in the biomin scenario, biomass is primarily applied to produce hydrogen, as this can be combined with CCS. As REMIND has no option for the electrification of the transport sector, imposing biomin means that less biofuels are available in the transport sector in the case of low stabilization. Hence the relative price of fuels for transport increases, transportation services demanded decrease, and economic costs rise. Applying the option of the electrification of the transport sector could probably reduce these high costs in the biomin scenario. In MERGE, it is mainly biomass use for combined heat and power (CHP) that is affected when limited amounts of biomass are available. Hydrogen production from biomass in combination with CCS enables the removal of CO2 from the air. POLES only has the option of biomass combined with pre-combustion, so in POLES the type of biomass use is not dependent on the biomass potential. In all cases it is mainly for production of CHP. The biomass potential stipulated in each case also affects the energy mix that results. It turns out that biomass is competing with other renewable energy sources in MERGE and REMIND (Figure 12). When increasing the biomass potential, the models take advantage of this possibility, whereas the amount of other renewable sources decline. Moreover, the transformation of the energy system is postponed in MERGE as biomass becomes available later on. On the other hand, restrictions placed on the biomass potential, speed development and the introduction of the other renewables. The reason for this is that a high biomass potential facilitates the removal of CO2 from the atmosphere. Greater reliance on this clean technology then opens the door to greater acceptance of gas and oil (MERGE) or coal (REMIND) into the energy mix. In MERGE, high availability of biomass and flexibility of the climate module enables the required emission reductions to be postponed to later in the century. Until then more fossil energy can be used. With a lower biomass potential, the emission reduction would have to start much earlier, raising mitigation costs. Similarly in REMIND, increasing use of coal in combination with CCS is the solution under biomax as rest-emissions from CCS use, i.e. emissions that cannot be captured, can then be accepted. With a lower biomass potential, however, the residual emissions remaining after CCS would still be sufficient to make the use of coal unattractive. In POLES, the effect of the biomass potential on the energy mix is not so explicit. With a reduced biomass potential, the models show increased energy efficiency and higher amounts of other renewables. In REMIND, additional experiments indicate that a potential of 80 EJ p.a. increases the costs up to 3.7% compared with Figure 11. With biomass potential restricted to 70 EJ p.a., the emission path cannot even be reached for stabilization at 400ppm. For 550ppm the target can still be achieved for 60 EJ p.a., and costs increase only moderately (to 0.6%).",342.00352

For stabilization at 550ppm, the cost increase due to imposing biomin is moderate by comparison (see Figure 11). In MERGE and REMIND, costs more than double with a restriction of the biomass potential in the 400ppm scenario, leading to a cost increase of 3.3 and 1.4 percentage points of GDP. In POLES, the target cannot be achieved. This is mainly due to the capture ratio used for biomass plants being limited to 70% of CO2 emissions. Conversely, for MERGE and REMIND, a higher biomass potential decreases the costs to nearly half compared to the reference 400ppm scenario.

However, there is a risk that some of the technology options will fail or the potential has been overestimated. These “2nd best” scenarios in view of technology availability and the values of particular technology options are explored in this section. To evaluate the “option value” of including a technology in a mitigation program, we start from conditions in which all mitigation options are available for use and then evaluate the extra costs that would arise from excluding any particular option from the full mitigation portfolio that would otherwise choose to contain it. Thus the benefits of having, say, CCS available for use in the mitigation program would be measured by the added costs of implementing such a program without it (scenario name “noccs”). We proceed in this way, one by one, when the deployment of renewables is fixed at baseline values (“norenew”) or when the use of nuclear power generation is held at baseline (“nonuke”). To further explore the role of biomass and CCS, we run some additional sensitivity analyses where the biomass potential is fixed alternatively at 100 EJ p.a. (“biomin”) and 400 EJ p.a. (“biomax”) compared with the standard biomass potential of 200 EJ p.a. in all models. For a discussion of that potential see van Vuuren et al., (2010, this Issue). For CCS, a constraint is set that limits the CCS storage potential to 120 GtC (“ccsmin”), compared with 400 GtC in MERGE, or with no advance constraints at all in the other models in the standard mitigation scenarios. Additional analyses on the use of nuclear include a nuclear phase-out scenario (“nuke phaseout”) and a scenario where the fast breeder option is available (“fbr”). All technology options being analyzed are listed in Table 4. They are evaluated for the 550ppm as well as for the 400ppm scenario by the models MERGE, REMIND and POLES. E3MG and TIMER are not included in the determination of option values either because of conceptual incompatibility (E3MG) or practical implementation difficulties due to code constraints (TIMER). The estimates of mitigation costs for the different technology options are given in Figure 11. The key findings are: (1) Mitigation costs can increase considerably when some technology options are not available or when the potential is much lower than assumed. In some cases these 2nd best assumptions lead to infeasibilities in reaching the low stabilization target. This implies that the flexibility of substituting one technology with another is lost in the case of low stabilization. (2) The ranking of options is robust across the models and across the two mitigation scenarios: a. Renewables and CCS are the most important technologies for mitigation because without them (i) the 400ppm target is not feasible and (ii) the 550ppm target gets very expensive. b. Nuclear is less important as a mitigation option as (i) 400ppm remains feasible without this option and (ii) the costs of",324.49784

They strongly depend on regional emission targets (so-called burden sharing regime) and the option of international emission trading. To provide an illustration of possible costs, we discuss here the results under a contraction and convergence regime with a convergence year of 2050 (i.e. the allocated emission permits on a per capita basis are equal in each region in 2050 before emission trading). We assume that emissions trading can be started in 2010 (see Figure 10)8 and the costs are evaluated for two different targets of 550ppm and 400ppm. While costs are primarily for illustration purposes, costs for the three developed country categories, EU27, USA, and Japan cluster closely together and are lower than for WORLD. The United States consistently has the highest costs of the three, but pairwise differences between costs of the industrialized countries are distinctly less than one percent within models and not much larger across models. By contrast, differences between the developing country groups or countries tend to show much larger variations between models and depend substantially on the target. China reports much higher costs than the world average in two out of three models. This could be an important sticking point in international negotiations, as China may demand compensation before consenting to high mitigation costs. India faces the highest mitigation costs in MERGE and POLES for 400ppm, and costs for India are higher than the World average in REMIND. In MERGE, Russia benefits substantially from its large biomass potential allowing it to sell emission permits, especially in the low stabilization case. By contrast, mitigation costs for Russia are higher than the World average in REMIND and POLES, especially for the 550ppm target. Hence results are difficult to generalize for developing countries, including ROW. The analysis shows that the mitigation costs depend very much on the assumptions about the availability of certain energy carriers in the specific regions, a result that is in line with other studies, e.g. by den Elzen et al. (2008). This suggests an area for further research. Summing up, despite the very different assumptions and structures employed in the models, four out of five models show a similar pattern in costs. Global mitigation costs fall into a limited range if one disregards results from the Keynesian demand-driven simulation model E3MG, which projects, on the contrary, benefits from climate change mitigation. A robust finding, independent of the energy mix and the applied technologies, appears to be that global mitigation costs are moderate if the whole portfolio of technologies is available and if one assumes global participation. Regional mitigation costs, however, show a much wider range for specific regions. The next section investigates whether there are robust findings concerning the importance of certain technologies, despite the different model assumptions.",342.0294

Key assumptions are that 40% of the revenues collected are recycled and used for R&D investments in renewables as well as for investments in energy savings and conversion of energy-intensive sectors towards low-carbon production methods. Revenue is also recycled via lowering indirect taxes to achieve fiscal neutrality. Moreover, the early introduction of electric plug-in vehicles has a major impact on the emission path. In contrast to the other models, E3MG is a simulation model without perfect foresight and optimization, where resources are not fully employed or optimally utilized in the baseline. The increase in investment induced by climate policy can therefore achieve net GDP gains. In other words, these gains are attributed to climate policy that induces and accelerates technological change towards low-carbon sources. It should be noted, though, that these gains can in principle be achieved by policies other than climate policy. The mitigation benefits and costs reported by E3MG vary greatly over future decades (see Figure 9) because investment cycles in new low-carbon technologies reflect the dynamics and non-linearities inherent in complex E3 systems. The wave of early investments in plug-in vehicles, greater energy efficiency in buildings and low-GHG energy supplies lead to an acceleration of GDP growth to 2040, producing negative costs. GDP then falls below baseline for two decades, yielding positive costs as the first-generation investments reach maturity and require replacement, before reverting to net gains in the final decades of the century with a new wave of investments in innovative low-carbon technologies.. For a detailed discussion on the assumption and specification of the E3MG model and the investment cycles see Barker and Scrieciu (2010, this Issue).",324.14978

Here the recursive simulation process and the detailed sectoral description accounts for the short-term inertia in the substitution of capital to energy in the various sectors. In the longer term, POLES provides more flexibility due to demand side options. The increase in carbon price induces greater energy efficiency, mostly through demand-side technological innovation, but also through modifications in consumer behavior. In POLES, stepped-up energy efficiency improvements are essential to reach the set CO2 mitigation objectives because decarbonizing the supply side alone will not be sufficient. Limiting factors are the amount of land available for alternative energy generation, e.g. wind power or biomass production as uranium is in short supply, and the mismatch between the most suitable production and consumption locations for alternative energy.

Figure 8 shows the corresponding time paths of annual mitigation costs expressed in percent of GDP. The costs calculated by the E3MG model are discussed separately in Section 4.2.2. In this model the baseline is not assumed to be fully efficient. This leads – in contrast to the other models – to the possibility of net gains from mitigation and needs a different appraisal of the costs. Concerning Figure 7 and Figure 8, it is important to note that the scenarios are not performed in a cost-benefit mode but – depending on the model – in a least cost approach or cost-effective mode. We only take into account the costs for mitigation and not for adaptation or avoided impacts. The focus of this analysis is on the appraisal of different mitigation options to reach a certain stabilization target. The models do not include costs of adaptation or saved costs due to the avoidance of damaging effects. Note also that a full appraisal of the options would include considerations of safety and risk issues (nuclear, CCS), energy security and public acceptability (nuclear, CCS). All models in Figure 7 show that costs increase with the stringency of the stabilization target. The costs for all stabilization targets are moderate, with aggregate losses for this century below 2.5% of GDP for the most stringent scenario in the case of MERGE and REMIND. The abatement costs in POLES and TIMER are of a similar order of magnitude. Interestingly, the annual costs displayed in Figure 8 are moderate until about 2040 but increase in all four models during the transition phase of the energy system and nearly stabilize or even decline thereafter. Overall, the cost estimates are comparable to those appearing in the IPCC AR4 (Fisher et al., 2007, Fig. 3.25, p. 205). In IMCP (Edenhofer et al., 2006) the costs were reported to be less than 1% of GDP for a target of 450ppm CO2-only that lies between our 550ppm and 450ppm CO2 eq target. Compared to these targets, this benchmark of 1% is also not exceeded here. The lower target of 400ppm shows higher costs but leads to a greater chance of achieving the 2 C̊ target. The costs increase approximately linearly with the probability of achieving the 2 C̊ target (not shown here but assessed similarly as in Schaeffer et al., 2008). In the IMCP (Edenhofer et al., 2006), induced technological change (ITC), which can be stimulated by policy measures, greatly affected costs. All models analyzed here include endogenous technological change.  Without allowing for ITC, costs would be higher, as additional investigations show. MERGE reports the highest costs for the 400ppm scenario but the lowest, at least until the middle of this century, for the 550ppm scenario. One reason is that due to an increasing use of coal, MERGE has much higher CO2 emissions at the end of the century in the baseline (see Figure 1) so that emission cuts are comparatively large. Compared to the other models, REMIND yields the lowest average annual mitigation costs overall in part because the price path for fossil energy is assumed to be high (see Figure 2) and renewable energy sources are already incorporated in the baseline. In addition, REMIND provides a high degree of flexibility in the choice of low-carbon technologies.",324.44225

These different cost concepts are laid out in Edenhofer et al. (2006). The costs reported for our models fall into different categories. For the energy system models, POLES and TIMER, the costs for the transition of the energy system (abatement costs) are provided, as GDP is prescribed exogenously. For the three other models, macroeconomic costs, welfare costs and abatement costs can be provided in principle. To allow for a comparison between the different cost concepts of the models, we report here mitigation cost  as net present value sums to 2100 of reduction of global GDP (of abatement costs for POLES and TIMER) relative to the like sum of baseline GDP values. We apply a discount rate of 3%. It should be noted that these costs concepts are not the same – and therefore one should be careful when comparing them. However, earlier comparisons showed that in relative terms the two seem to correlate reasonably well across different scenarios and for different regions (Hof et al., 2009). In all models, the carbon price drives investments in carbon-free technologies (in E3MG the recycling of revenues of auctioning also plays a role, see section 4.2.2). The price for CO2 rises over time in most models, and, at any time, the price in the 400ppm scenario is more than five times as high as in the 550ppm scenario (Figure 6). But although the high price by the end of this century affects only a small amount of CO2 emissions (see Figure 3, left), it still prevents fossil fuels from re-entering the energy system.",324.06828

Any CO2 changes from baseline that are required to achieve the mitigation target can take the form of reductions in (1) carbon intensity, CI, defined as CO2 emissions per primary energy, (2) energy intensity, EI, defined as primary energy per GDP, or (3) growth of GDP. A decomposition analysis facilitates quantifying the contributions of these different factors (see Figure 5). In nearly all cases reducing CI is the most important strategy, particularly in the strict stabilization targets. Except for E3MG, the reduction of EI plays only a minor role as a mitigation option. One issue to note here is that all models pay considerably less attention to end-use energy efficiency technologies than to supply side technologies (which could create a bias towards favouring CI improvement). Moreover, energy intensity reduces in the baseline from 0.8% to 1.2% per annum across the models, which is in line with the historical record (e.g. Nakicenovic et al., 2000, Fig. 3-13; Fischer et al., 2007, Fig. 3.6).

In the former scenario the main option is increasing energy efficiency, which is an important demand-side option in E3MG. There are incentives for improving the energy efficiency of private residences and household appliances. Furthermore, regulatory policies pressing for decarbonization of the transport sector through electrification of the vehicle fleet play a major role. In the 400ppm scenario, the renewables and biomass options become more and more important. Because of learning curves, economies of scale, and Keynesian multiplier effects throughout the global economy (via trade and low-carbon technology spill-over effects) creating additional employment of resources that would otherwise have been unemployed in the baseline, the costs associated with increased reliance on renewables are much reduced. This induces large-scale adoption of low-carbon technologies. Three further findings are especially noteworthy: (1) In some models nuclear energy appears to be important as an interim energy source around the middle of this century. The fraction of nuclear power increases in most models until 2050 and then declines, at least in some models, due partly to the depletion of uranium.  (2) In POLES and REMIND, and to a lesser extent also in TIMER and MERGE, the total amount of CCS shows little variation with the emission stabilization target. For the stricter target, CCS is combined with biomass rather than coal. This is because one way to remove carbon from the atmosphere and to obtain “negative emissions” is to combine biomass with CCS. In the case of the 550ppm scenario, negative emissions are not needed, and the use of coal and gas in combination with CCS suffices to reach the stabilization target. (3) Compared to its use in the baseline, the use of oil decreases minimally in some models, moderately in others (TIMER) and very extensively in E3MG. The position of oil in the transport sector is relatively strong. In the models in which oil continues to be used extensively, it is in fact still used for transport at the end of the century and is the major source for the remaining CO2 emissions.",342.09122

This is a very important result because, as noted in the Introduction (Section 1), not many modeling results have been reported for such low emissions-stabilization targets. However, some of the models in our analysis had to be equipped with a wider portfolio of low-carbon technologies, such as CCS and biomass in combination with CCS, to enhance their mitigation capabilities and to be able to reach this low emission level. The next section will focus on the mechanisms and interactions involved in achieving these targets. In the mitigation scenarios (Figure 4, middle and right columns), the energy mix and the underlying strategies for a specific model is closer across its own 550ppm and the 400ppm targets than in comparison with other models for any given target. It shows that each model in fact emphasizes a particular strategy (vis-à-vis the other models): MERGE and E3MG rely primarily on renewable energy sources, TIMER on CCS, POLES on energy efficiency, and REMIND relies on CCS mainly in combination with biomass. This demonstrates that the energy mix is a function principally of each model’s assumptions about the available technologies, learning rates, and resource prices. A partial exception to this insensitivity of the energy mix at least in the timing of the strategies to the level of stabilization is MERGE. In this model, the flexibility provided by having its own climate module and not being restricted to the prescribed CO2 path (cf. Table 3) allows the transformation of the energy system to be postponed in the case of the less ambitious target. The main mitigation options that eventually start to be exercised are renewables and biomass. Hydrogen production from solar thermal, and for non-electric consumption, is an option in MERGE that becomes extremely important with stricter targets. Improvements in energy efficiency also play an important part. In TIMER, POLES and REMIND, the use of fossil energy without CCS is very similar as here the emission path is constrained by the exogenous time series for CO2 emissions (cf. Table 3). The carbon-free contributions to the energy mix, however, vary between the models: (1) In POLES, reduction of energy use is an important strategy as POLES has demand-side energy efficiency improvements in a bottom-up representation. In general, higher energy prices can spur technological improvements that lead to energy savings in production, and they can also produce changes in behavior, as in residential uses and private transportation, which lead to energy savings in consumption. Inertias in the energy system lead to smooth transitions; (2) In TIMER, CCS with coal is the main option (CCS with biomass is only allowed in the most stringent stabilization scenario). With more CCS than in any of the other models, TIMER uses a CCS storage potential of 520 GtC, compared e. g. to 280 GtC in MERGE. In TIMER, despite high learning rates in the beginning of the century (see Table 2), renewables are quite expensive and do not play a larger role in the mitigation scenarios compared to its level in the baseline; (3) REMIND shows a steady increase of primary energy consumption because decarbonization is available at moderate cost with CCS and renewables. Due to this low cost, energy efficiency improvements, here in a top-down representation, play only a minor role. Here the option of combining biomass use with CCS to remove CO2 from the atmosphere becomes an important option. Biomass in REMIND is associated with a high flexibility in its use (see Table 2). In the policy scenarios, the primary energy consumption from biomass-CCS is connected mainly with H2 production for transport (as this allows the combination with CCS) and not biomass-to-liquid, as in the baseline scenario.",342.05584

POLES contains endogenous learning curves with a threshold that depends on technology floor costs (minimum engineering cost). The energy mix changes only slightly over time in the baseline scenario due to inertia in capital-intensive energy production and distribution systems. Renewables develop in the POLES model even in the baseline scenario because of their cost efficiency in the long term. Wind energy is capped by its technical potential in relation to land availability (basically natural plains areas differentiated by wind speed classes with an excluding factor linked to the population density). For decentralized production, solar PV is constrained by the available surface space of buildings. The theoretical potential of solar thermodynamic power plants is linked to the size of sunny desert regions, but this vast potential is not usable for export because of the unavailability of transcontinental electricity grids and H2 transmission lines. REMIND takes renewables, in particular biomass, into the baseline. The biomass and renewables option becomes competitive because of increasing fossil fuel prices arising from scarcity in the second half of the century (see Figure 2). Biomass is a general-purpose energy carrier; it can be converted into all secondary energy carriers. Biomass-to-liquid is available at comparable prices to those of coal-to-liquid but using biomass helps to conserve coal for conversion into other secondary energy carriers, such as electricity, and for later use. REMIND considers changes in the relative prices of energy carriers, driven by uneven rates of technological advance in the different sectors, as the main factor that can change the energy mix. For instance, conversion coefficients of technologies using fossil fuels tend to improve gradually over time while marginal costs of investing in wind and solar PV may be lowered dramatically through innovations resulting from learning-by-doing. In E3MG, the baseline incorporates some decarbonization of the global economy as the historical trend of falling carbon intensity is projected into the future. This trend combined with endogenous technological change leads to a significant replacement of fossil fuels, particularly coal, with low-carbon energy sources after 2050 following investment cycles particularly in renewables. Combined with some energy efficiency improvements, this results in a slight reduction in annual CO2 emissions from 2060 onwards, although it is far from achieving any significant reductions. The comparison of the baselines shows that despite a number of similar assumptions, e.g., about population and GDP development, each model is different in its vision of the future. This indeed is a major advantage of a model comparison exercise as these models are then able to cover a wide range of possible futures.",324.09959

MERGE and TIMER rely mostly on coal; renewables are not important. Also in the POLES model, only a little decarbonization occurs. The energy mix in the REMIND baseline however, is characterized by strong decarbonization through the use of biomass and the introduction of renewable energy sources.  In E3MG, renewables increase significantly in the baseline. The models tell the following stories in their baselines: In the MERGE baseline, the price of coal is low relative to natural gas and oil which are largely exhausted in the course of this century. This leads to high levels of coal use and hence more exploitation of electricity generation from coal and of coal-to-liquids fuel production. Both technologies benefit from technological learning. Nuclear power is an important technology in the baseline scenario, particularly towards the middle of the century. This is again driven by the relatively low costs of generation. However, in a baseline in which only light water reactors and limited uranium resources are assumed to be available, scarcity of these resources becomes a key constraint on any longer-term role for nuclear energy. Wind power technology shows moderate improvements in cost arising from learning. Most other renewable energy sources remain uncompetitive in the baseline scenario. In the TIMER baseline, fossil fuels remain the dominant energy carriers throughout the century, with the share of oil decreasing due to rising oil prices. The choice of energy carriers in TIMER is determined by cost and by their suitability for use in the various sectors. Costs increase as resources are used up, but decrease due to learning-by-doing. The demand for “modern” biofuels for both electricity and liquid-fuel production increases gradually as the costs of oil and natural gas rise. In addition, technological improvements in production also make these biofuels more competitive. Wind energy use increases steadily, although it remains a minor part of global energy use, while solar energy remains too expensive for large-scale use.",324.01761

Different assumptions driving the models, for instance concerning the prices of fossil fuels or about learning rates and the emergence of breakthrough technologies, span a range of possible pathways to the future. This is a major advantage of this model comparison as it allows the underlying assumptions that lead to different trajectories of the future energy mix to be identified in the baseline as well as in the mitigation scenarios.

In MERGE for instance, CO2 emissions increase much more than in other models. This is due to low fossil fuel prices encouraging continued use of coal, gas and oil. Conversely, the low CO2 emission pathway for REMIND arises from assuming a high cost path for fossil fuels. Hence a switch away from coal to renewables is already captured to some degree in the baseline.

POLES and TIMER are bottom-up energy system models with a high resolution of different technologies. The macroeconomic dynamics are exogenous to these models. The E3MG model is an econometric simulation hybrid model. Table 1 gives a classification of the models. As none of the models takes damages from climate change into account, the models are not run in a cost-benefit but rather cost-effective mode. The remainder of this section introduces the models and reflects on their advantages and limitations. MERGE represents a modified version of MERGE5 described by Kypreos and Bahn (2003) and Manne and Richels (2004a; 2004b). Key features include a nine-region global disaggregation, a combined ‘top-down’ Ramseytype economic and ‘bottom-up’ engineering modeling approach, a simple climate model, and international trade. Regional technological learning with global spillovers and costly climate-change impacts enhance the regional links and interactions (Magné et al., 2010, this Issue). Technologies for electricity generation (including options for CCS), and secondary fuel production (synthetic fuels from coal and biomass, H2 from a range of sources, including options for CCS) are explicitly included in MERGE. Technological learning is represented by two-factor learning curves for technology investment costs. A limitation in MERGE is that the model relies on perfect competition and information, production/utility function continuity, representative agents, etc. The low level of technology detail also permits only a generic representation of end-use energy efficiency as explicit end-use technologies are not represented. The global multi-region model REMIND represents an intertemporal optimizing energy-economy-environment model which maximizes global welfare subject to equilibrium conditions on different markets. REMIND is a hybrid model which couples an economic growth model with a detailed energy system model and a simple climate model via a hard-link. The main advantage of REMIND is a high technological resolution of the energy system with more than 50 conversion technologies and intertemporal trade relations between the 11 world regions. Trade is modeled for coal, gas, oil, uranium, and the residual composite good as well as for emission permits. Macroeconomic output is determined by a nested CES production function of labor, capital and several end-use types of energy. The switch between energy technologies is a crucial element of endogenous technological change in REMIND. This is supplemented by learning-curve effects that impact the investment costs of wind and solar technologies. While providing a first-best solution based on the perfect foresight assumption, a drawback in REMIND is that it ignores market imperfections and treats technological change as exogenous in the macroeconomic sector. The POLES model is a global sectoral model of the world energy system. It has been developed in the framework of a hierarchical structure of interconnected sub-models at the international, regional and national levels. This partial-equilibrium model is solved year-by-year through recursive simulation. It makes provision for international energy prices that are endogenous and for lagged adjustments of supply and demand by world region. The model provides comprehensive energy balances for 47 countries and regions, among them the members of the OECD and key developing countries. Many parts of the global energy system are detailed in POLES, from the primary energy supply sector (oil and gas discovery module) to fairly detailed demand modules (industry, transport, services and dwellings). The latter feature is an important advantage of the POLES model. A limitation of the model is that it uses only currently used or fully documented prospective technologies. However, by 2100, future advances in fundamental science may trigger the development of completely new technological concepts. Within the Integrated Model to Assess the Global Environment (IMAGE), the global energy system model TIMER describes the investment in, and the use of, different types of energy options within a simulation framework. The value of these options is affected by technology development (learning-by-doing) and resource depletion. The TIMER model describes long-term trends in the world energy system. It encompasses long-term energy demand, resource depletion and technology development affecting various energy sources, cost-based substitution in production, and the development of climate policy. The substitution across different energy carriers is described on the basis ofmultinomial logit equations. IMAGE computes land-use changes and emissions from land use, natural ecosystems and agricultural production systems. The model also takes account of the exchange of carbon dioxide between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere. The IMAGE model is particularly strong in the detailed description of energy technologies and of geographically explicit land use. The integration of land and energy use in one model is itself noteworthy. A drawback of the model is that economic development is treated as an exogenous driver. Hence changes in the energy sector and in land use are decoupled from changes in GDP. E3MG is a macro-econometric non-equilibrium hybrid simulation model of the global E3 system, estimated on annual data 1971-2002. It is used for annual projections to 2030 and in 10-year intervals thereafter to 2100. E3MG is based upon a New Economics view of long-term dynamics (Barker, 2008), drawing as well on Post Keynesian features taking a historical approach of cumulative causation and demand-led growth, and incorporating technological progress in gross investment enhanced by research and development (R&D) expenditures. It is a non-equilibrium model implying that labor, foreign exchange and financial markets do not necessarily clear but have deficits or surpluses in open economies depending on the year and region. A bottom-up energy-technology simulation has been incorporated allowing for the explicit modeling of 28 energy technologies. This allows for the modelling of a two-way feedback between the economy, energy demand/supply and anthropogenic emissions. One of the model’s limitations is that parameters estimated from a recent time series of 32-years may not be time-invariant over coming decades. Low stabilization crucially depends on assumptions about available technologies. This is evident from Azar et al. (2006), Rao et al. (2008) and van Vuuren et al. (2007). Table 2 provides an overview of specific model features concerning assumptions on low carbon technologies. In all of the models no leakage for CCS storages is assumed, but most assume a limited capture rate. Some models apply a limit on the CCS storage capacity. The IPCC (Metz et al., 2005) estimates a technical potential of at least 545 GtC of storage capacity in geological formations up to a much higher potential when including saline formations. All models assume a biomass potential of 200 EJ/yr as a reference, compared to typical estimates in the order of 0-150 EJ/yr for residues and about 100-200 EJ/yr for bio-energy crops (cf. van Vuuren et al., 2010, this Issue). TIMER assumes a slightly higher biomass use compared to the other models, in the 400ppm scenario, e.g., 290 EJ/yr used at its maximum, but at the same time TIMER assumes a larger amount of traditional biomass compared to all other models. The models do not account for co-emissions from biomass use such as those resulting from fertilizer application. All models apply assumptions about learning-by-doing, especially for renewable energy sources (cf. Table 2). Nordhaus (2009) points out that learning coefficients tend to be overestimated and that in optimization models a bias towards technologies with high learning rates is manifested. This effect is not accounted for in the models. Moreover, R&D investments in the energy system, as applied in the models, may crowd out investments in other sectors of the economy (Popp and Newell, 2008). This effect is also not considered here and it is assumed that measures for energy R&D do not shift R&D investment from other sectors, but rather increase the total R&D expenditure.",324.13105

Since then, a few new studies on stabilization levels below 450 ppm CO2 eq have been published, including work by van Vuuren et al. (2007) exploring 400ppm CO2 eq, den Elzen and van Vuuren (2007) considering the effects of peaking in mitigation scenarios, and Azar et al. (2006) focusing on bioenergy with carbon capture. More recently, Rao et al. (2008) investigate the 400ppm CO2 eq profile by van Vuuren et al. (2007) with the models MESSAGE and IMAGE/TIMER. Nordhaus (2007) reports results for a 1.5 °C target but at relatively high costs. Some model studies even report infeasibilities of low concentration levels (e.g. Tol, 2009). Van Vuuren et al. (2006c) point out that assumptions on technologies are crucial for achieving low stabilization targets and Rao et al. (2008) report infeasibilities of low stabilization targets under different baseline assumptions. As low stabilization will most probably depend on the available technologies implemented in the models, we focus in detail on this aspect. Moreover, feasibility depends on the early and full participation of all countries (e.g. Luderer et al. (2009), Clarke et al. (2009)). The challenge of increasing global participation is addressed in Knopf et al. (2010, this Issue). Model comparison analysis can help identify a range of pathways to a low carbon economy and shed light on the robustness of the associated cost estimates and technology options. Edenhofer et al., (2006) provide an overview of this literature. Recent examples that were included in the IPCC AR4 (Fisher et al., 2007) are comparisons by the Stanford University based Energy Modeling Forum (EMF), with EMF-21 focusing on multi-gas mitigation (Weyant et al., 2006, van Vuuren et al., 2006b) and EMF-19 on technology and climate change policy (Weyant, 2004). The Innovation Modeling Comparison Project (IMCP) by Edenhofer et al. (2006) focused on endogenous technological change, and the Climate Change Science Program (CCSP) (Clarke et al., 2007) in the United States presented a comparison of three models. A number of such comparisons are already completed, for instance within the EMF on transition scenarios in the EMF-22 (Clarke et al., 2009), or a comparison on sectoral analysis of the energy system (Luderer et al., 2009, van Vuuren et al. 2009b). Exploring the lower limit ofstabilization and attaining robust information concerning the importance of individual technologies for low stabilization is the overarching challenge and focus of the model comparison in this paper. We are aware that pure model analysis is insufficient to address the full range of socio-economic, political and risk management issues potentially raised by the transition to low-carbon stabilization. Nevertheless, we concentrate here on the technical feasibility and economic viability and will not discuss the socio-economic or political feasibility of low stabilization scenarios. These issues are beyond the scope of this model comparison but are addressed in detail in Knopf et al. (2010, this Issue). The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the models used; Section 3 describes the baseline and the policy scenarios; Section 4 then applies the models and compares the economic and technical results for harmonized baselines with the mitigation scenarios. It discusses alternative ways to achieve low stabilization and explains how individual technology options can be valued. Section 5 offers conclusions.",342.50605

Reaching the target of climate stabilization at no more than 2°C above pre-industrial levels by the end of this century – which is how the European Union (EU) interprets Article 2 – is a historic challenge for humankind. To make it likely that this challenge will be met, greenhouse gas concentrations have to be limited to at least 450 ppm CO2 equivalent (for a 50 % likelihood) or below. This presupposes a portfolio of mitigation options for very stringent emission reductions and requires taking action now. The 2°C target must not only be technically feasible but also readily affordable economically if it is to be acceptable to stakeholders and decisionmakers around the world. Obviously, this is a rather ambiguous criterion, as it depends among others on the assumed benefits of climate policy. To support climate policy making in this paper, we evaluate the technological feasibility of reaching these stabilization targets, explore the importance of individual technologies and estimate the associated economic costs. We do so using a multi-model approach, allowing comparison of results across different models as well as some assessment of model-related uncertainty. Specifically, we try to answer two key questions: (1) What are the technical and economic consequences of different targets that could be consistent with the 2 C̊ target? Specifically, we explore three different CO2 stabilization scenarios (550, 450 and 400 ppm CO2 eq). The probabilities for reaching a 2 C̊ target associated with these concentration levels increase from approximately 20% (550ppm), to 50% (450ppm), and 80% (400ppm CO2 eq), based on the uncertainty in climate sensitivity (Hare and Meinshausen, 2006). (2) What are some ofthe technological barriers or economic and political factors that are crucial for the intended emissions stabilization outcome? For example, what can still be achieved if some of the technology options fail or are ruled out? In this context, it should be noted that some of the technologies that may be indispensable for reaching very low emission paths – such as large-scale use of biomass, Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), or nuclear power may be saddled with high risks and adverse side effects. In order to assess the two key questions, five global regionalized energy-environment-economy models (E3) are compared in a coordinated manner.  So far, only few energy-environment-economy models have assessed the attainability 1. The comparison has been performed as part of the ADAM project (Adaptation and mitigation strategies: supporting European climate policy), www.adamproject.eu. of such low concentration levels but exploring low stabilization targets has become increasingly relevant in recent years. This growing interest in ambitious climate stabilization scenarios may well be attributable to a clearer realization of at least two factors. First, only recently has public appreciation of the need for low stabilization to limit the damage expected from continued increases in global mean temperature strengthened. It is now realized that global warming will have severe impacts (e.g., Stern, 2007; Parry et al., 2007; Hansen et al., 2007; Smith et al., 2009) and that further temperature increases may trigger tipping points in the climate system (Lenton et al., 2008). This has stimulated more interest in the corresponding scenarios and how to achieve them in the short-term. Second there was a technical reason why little had been done before. Inflexibilities in the energy systems, shortcomings in applications of mitigation technologies, and myopic investment behavior are among the reasons why low concentration pathways have so far been assessed and achieved by only a small number of models. In general, however, the space occupied by low-stabilization targets in both the politically and economically feasible regions has increased.",324.4418

Finally, we examine bottom-up policy scenarios, or what might be referred to as “second best” approaches, in which individual regions and countries take on emissions reductions of varying stringency based on domestic goals and ability to pay. The G8m proposal reflects an aggressive plan motivated by discussions ofworld leaders in recent years, while a fragmented policy is intended to reflect an extension of our current course as defined by recent commitments. We have demonstrated the potentially significant role ofa BECS technology in determining the emissions pathway and costs involved in meeting the most stringent of our targets.. If BECS or other negative emissions options are not to be used, phase out ofcarbon emissions may be necessary at an unprecedented rate. If BECS is to be a significant part of the mix, the possibility exists for significant overshoot on the way to meeting the target, which changes the nature of the environmental outcome. Regardless ofthe policy scenario, it is clear that R&D investments that enhance the available suite oftechnological options will lead to large reductions in the cost ofcompliance. At the same time, regardless ofthe technology scenario, it is clear that neither the G8m nor the Fragmented Policy scenarios are likely to stay below a 2 ° C temperature increase, while the inefficient allocation of mitigation effort will significantly increase the costs of a given climate outcome. Measuring the economic cost of mitigation is only part of the story, but it is an essential part. Economic cost analysis enables us to assess the feasibility of alternative proposals and to determine which measure and technologies can provide the most value. On the other hand, what a rapid transition might mean for net unemployment and social dissonance is far beyond the scope of this analysis. For tight targets, costs both measured and unmeasured are likely to be high, and accepting them will likely call for a great deal ofpolitical will. A universal agreement that such a policy is justified would require an overwhelming belief that catastrophic climate change is imminent. Given public sentiment to date, this will require a major shift in current thinking. We close by noting that a reduction in emissions is not the sole policy response available. Adaptation is also an option. At which point is adaptation more cost-effective than mitigation? A careful analysis is a prerequisite for identifying where that point might be. Delays in climate system response suggest that adaptation may be the only option for near-term climate change. The issue of what constitutes expensive depends upon society’s perception of what is at stake. The greater the apparent threat, the higher will be our willingness to pay to protect current and future generations. Unfortunately, there remains considerable uncertainty regarding the stakes and their likelihood. As noted in the recent report by the National Academy of Sciences “America’s Climate Choices”,  the issue calls for iterative risk management. Our strategy",346.01355

In one scenario, the combination of CCS and large-scale sustainable bioenergy production is available to future generations, allowing net negative emissions later on, and the near-term mitigation pathway is aggressive but not extreme. On the other end of the spectrum, the option for negative emissions in the future is unavailable, and the present generation engages in immediate drastic emissions reductions. Both pathways rely on large wind and nuclear growth, and the later pathway also employs significant solar combined with a global weaning off of fossil fuels by mid-century. Clearly, both pathways involve grappling with demanding societal transformations fraught with challenging issues and uncertainty. Along the first pathway, we rely heavily on the emergence of a particular technology. While CCS has been demonstrated, and biomass boilers for electric generation exist today, and there is no fundamental technology barrier involved in combining them, nonetheless it is far from clear that BECS can be deployed at the scale seen in this analysis. With respect to biomass supply, there are social concerns related to induced land-use change, potential food price effects, and net environmental concerns that could constrain biomass feedstock use.  There are also engineering issues with large scale energy conversion ofbiomass feedstocks, such as handling and fouling; and BECS facilities have yet to be demonstrated.  With respect to CCS, capture is costly but proven, geologic storage potential is vast, yet the prospects for effectively storing CO2 underground, perhaps forever, remain unknown. CO2 is heavier than air, and a major leak during the transportation or sequestration stage could lead to substantial loss of life. We do not suggest that CCS or BECS should not or could not play a substantial role in the transition to climate stabilization, but more analysis of the risks and benefits is needed to make an informed decision. At the present time, we have incomplete information on both sides of the ledger. The second pathway instead commits us to reducing emissions as fast as possible. This forces an examination ofhow quickly new low- or zero-carbon energy supply technologies could in fact be brought online. There would likely be limits based on bottlenecks in financial or commodity markets, which are difficult to quantify. Political will for such a transition is certainly another ingredient. For example, if there emerged an unequivocal perception of impending and calamitous climate change, might we not be induced to remove barriers wherever possible to the adoption of new technologies? It is possible that such an environment is more consistent with the sense ofurgency that would go along with the adoption ofa policy like the 2.8os W/m2 target. We acknowledge that the circumstances leading to the adoption ofsuch a policy may currently be unlikely. We also note that our measurement ofmitigation costs is limited to the deadweight losses associated with adopting one set oftechnologies over another to achieve a climate target. As such it does not account for other costs that may be incurred by accelerating the turnover ofthe energy capital stock: the social costs (e.g. related to unemployment or displacement), the costs of accelerating R&D, or the political “capital” spent to engineer the transition. Implementation of aggressive climate targets needs to be examined in terms ofboth social, as well as economic costs, and to the extent possible, benefits. In either pathway, we have also assumed universal participation in the coalition from the outset. Will all countries be willing to take substantial action beginning in 2020? If past experience is an indication, the prospects are bleak. We do not rule out such an eventuality, but considerable and compelling evidence will be needed ofthe possibility ofimpending and significant consequences without substantial emissions reductions. Finally, it must be emphasized that from an environmental perspective, an overshoot is problematic. To the extent exercised, an overshoot could involve rapid increases in radiative forcing in the near-term and thus more rapid rise in temperature. However, the consequences of global warming may be due as much to the rate of temperature change as absolute temperature. Moreover, the higher temperature and rates of change associated with overshoot may bring us closer to “tipping points” at which irreversible or discontinuous changes occur. That is, it is unclear whether we can return to the same planet we left.  Overshoot enhances our ability to shift effort away from the present, when mitigation costs are highest, toward the more distant future when we will (presumably) have greater technological wherewithal to make emission reductions (perhaps even net negative). But if catastrophic climate change is somewhere in the foreseeable future, an overshoot pathway could in fact push us over the “climate cliff”. Of course, we do not know the likelihood of the future described above. Some have argued strenuously that it is highly unlikely, in terms of a variety of aspects: the science, the economics, public opinion, political will, and so forth. Others say that the science is clear; the issue is one of convincing the public and policymakers that such drastic action is required. If the past is any indication, such convincing will require demonstrable and observable evidence that the “cliff” is near. Regardless ofthe resolution, there appears to be an inconsistency between overshoot, which is intended to reduce GDP losses, and the belief that an unacceptable “tipping point” is near.",345.964207

Ultimately, the analysis seeks to illustrate the cost implications of these alternatives and how effectively they contribute to climate mitigation. Costs in our analysis are measured in terms of deadweight loss, that is, GDP foregone in order to achieve a mitigation goal. Figure 5 gives some insight into the importance of the technology assumptions in the cost of each policy. The figure shows cumulative GDP losses discounted to 2010 at 5 % per year. Most notable is the exceptionally high costs for the 2.8os W/m2 target when CCS, and thus BECS, is not available. In these constrained cases, there is enormous pressure to transform the energy system immediately. When CCS and BECS are available, the target pathway can take advantage of “negative” emissions in the second half of the century, closer to the target date, and the near-term cuts need not be so deep and costly. Interestingly, constraining nuclear has a lesser impact on GDP losses than the absence of CCS. When nuclear is available it plays a substantial role, particularly in the low energy efficiency case. But when it is unavailable, other “zero” emitting technologies are available to replace it (typically at a cost). But there is no replacement (in our model) for the negative emissions flow enabled by BECS when CCS is unavailable. The 3.7 W/m2 target is somewhat more relaxed. Again, BECS plays an important role in reducing GDP losses. Recall that BECS plays two potentially important and overlapping roles. However, its role is restricted to creating “headroom” for fossil fuels that otherwise would have to be replaced or reduced. Next, we turn to the two bottom-up policies, both of which exclude the Group 3 countries. Compared to the globally harmonized regime implied by the top-down policies, this incomplete participation presents a major obstacle to economic efficiency since the entire burden falls on Group 1 and Group 2 countries. The G8m policy is particularly difficult. All countries in Groups 1 and 2 must participate from the outset to meet an ambitious constraint. Since trade in emission rights with Group 3 is prohibited, these countries are forced even higher up their marginal abatement cost curves to meet their goals. Compounding the difficulty is that the stipulated target for 2050 must be met in that year, constraining “when” flexibility in addition to “where” flexibility. Interestingly, although the G8m radiative forcing path is quite similar to that of the",346.923874

Finally, Group 3 emissions track BAU closely, and as mentioned above are much lower in the Full Portfolio due to energy efficiency. Group 3 is a relatively small component of global emissions in the baseline, but a large fraction of the remaining emissions in the policy cases, especially in G8m. Although many raise concerns about emissions leakage to non-participants through trade and other effects, MERGE in fact displays “negative” leakage in that Group 3 emissions in the G8m scenario are lower than BAU. This is because the reduction in conventional oil demand in Groups 1 and 2 obviates the transition to more carbon-intensive liquid substitutes in the baseline, thus emissions in Group 3 are lower despite actually consuming more energy (positive leakage through the fuel price). In effect, oil-exporters get to consume more oftheir own product while the rest of the world decarbonizes. Figure 4 compares the global emissions pathways across all policy regimes in the Full and Limited Portfolio scenarios. The impact of the accelerated energy efficiency improvements assumed in the Full Portfolio indicates that much larger percentage-based cuts are required with standard efficiency assumptions. The G8m scenario as implemented is roughly consistent with a 3.7 W/m2 stabilization regime (rather than the more stringent target 2.8os W/m2 case), while the FP case results in stabilization of emissions, rather than concentrations or forcing. From an historical perspective, all policy scenarios except the FP require a radical departure from the past. The current growth trajectory in non-OECD countries (Groups 2 and 3), which encompass 80 % of the world’s population but only just over half its emissions, implies that affordable carbon-free technologies must be available and rapidly deployed in these emerging and industrializing economies if we hope to meet any of the more stringent targets considered here.",346.90118

We now turn to a “second best” world, one where participation may be staggered and some countries do not choose to participate (at least during the present century). These bottom-up policies are intended to represent scenarios which are more tangible and realistic about commitments that individual countries might adopt. Figure 3 shows emissions and reductions from baseline in 2100 for the G8m and FP scenarios with country groupings disaggregated. In both policy regimes, Group 1 emissions are nearly eliminated, and in fact are slightly negative in the Full Portfolio when BECS is available. The major difference between the two policies is in the level of mitigation occurring in Group 2 countries (such as China, India, and most other currently developing nations). In the G8m scenario, the goal imposed on the combined emissions of Groups 1 and 2 implies that drastic reductions happen in both groups. Group 2 also has net negative emissions by the end of the century. Meanwhile, the target formula in FP for countries with relatively lower incomes leads to still significant but smaller reductions. It is important to note that the chart shows CO2 emissions only, while the emissions limits are defined in terms of a sum of all Kyoto gas emissions on a CO2-equivalent basis.

The right side of Fig. 1 shows emissions (d), radiative forcing (e) and temperature change (f), respectively for the same range of technology scenarios discussed for the 2.8os W/m2 target. Whereas the more stringent target had a wide range of emissions, forcing, and temperature outcomes, varying with the availability of BECS, the 3.7 W/m2 “not-to-exceed” pathway is largely insensitive to technology. Also, the target is not sufficiently stringent to necessitate a negative emissions flow. However, the requirement that forcing never exceed the target level allows less “when” flexibility relative to the case when overshoot is allowed, since it effectively places a limit on “indebtedness” during the transition. Note that roughly the same amount of CO2 is released into the atmosphere in each scenario. This result reflects the role of BECS in creating “headroom” for continued fossil fuel use. This is particularly true for the nonelectric sector, where there are fewer and more expensive substitutes for coal, gas, and oil applications (not shown). Without BECS (i..e in the Low CCS case), 2100 non-electric emissions fall 90 % in the 3.7 W/m2 case relative to BAU (versus 66 % when BECS is available to the electric sector in the Default case).",345.9491

The three panels constituting the left side ofFig. 1 show emissions, radiative forcing, and temperature change, respectively for a range of technology scenarios. These include the Default case, a case with low bioenergy potential (“Low Bioenergy”), and a case without CCS availability (“Low CCS”). As represent-ed in Table 1, Low Bioenergy and Low CCS are independent sensitivity scenarios, i.e., the latter is simply Low CCS, not Low Bioenergy and Low CCS. In the Default case, the model is able to make full use of the BECS technology in the electric sector (subject to our assumed resource limits on sustainable biomass production) to create net negative carbon emissions by the end of the century. In the Low Bioenergy case, the use of BECS is partially constrained due to the lower availability of biomass, and in the Low CCS case it is completely constrained due to the unavailability of CCS. Note the 3.7 W/m2 results in Fig. 1 are discussed in the next section. As shown in Fig. 1(a), the emissions pathway for meeting the 2100 2.8os W/m2 target is highly dependent on the ability to deploy BECS. In the Default case, the optimal pathway is only moderately stringent in the near term because of the tremendous opportunity for future abatement with BECS. The greater the opportunity to deploy BECS, the greater is the amount of overshoot, i.e., higher near-term emissions and lower end-of-century emissions. IfCCS is never available, there is no opportunity for BECS and the target can only be met by drastic and immediate cuts. It is the Low CCS technology variant that proved infeasible under the standard configuration with a 2.8os W/m2 target, which raises questions about the viability of even more stringent targets and targets for which overshoot is not permitted. Figure 1(b) shows the implications for radiative forcing. The rise in emissions in the near-term in the Default case leads to a continued increase in forcing; the negative emissions “scrubbing” of atmospheric CO2 leads to a rapid decline later on. On the other hand, if CCS is not available, there can be very little overshoot without other options for negative emissions. The implications for actual (transient) temperature change, which is a lagged function of total radiative forcing, are shown in Fig. 1(c). The chart indicates that the assumptions about biomass supply and CCS can have a profound effect on the temperature pathway. Perhaps ironically, the scenario with the most pessimistic technology assumptions leads to the lowest temperature pathway. The conventional result would be that more technology options facilitate more aggressive cost-effective mitigation. Removing the option of overshoot via BECS decreases temperature by as much as 0.4 ° C in 2100. This result suggests that great care be taken when interpreting results from overshoot policy scenarios, since the (uncontrolled) extent of overshoot has a first-order impact on the ultimate effectiveness of the policy, in terms of both the level and rate of temperature rise. Figure 2 shows the deployment oftechnology in the electric and nonelectric sectors under the three technology scenarios described above for the 2.8os W/m2 policy. In the electric sector, note the small role of conventional fossil fuels with CCS relative to that of BECS. With a very tight target, the primary value of CCS is in enabling negative emissions via BECS. We can observe that when CCS is available, most biomass is directed to electric generation with BECS –the direct air capture services are more valuable than using biomass in the non-electric sector.  Without the prospect of future negative emissions, as in the Low CCS case, the tight target requires large and rapid contraction of fossil fuel based energy. As shown later, this reduction in energy supply is tremendously costly for the economy. Nuclear and renewable generation play large roles in addition to BECS, especially when there is no CCS. In the non-electric sector, which must eventually become carbon-free as well, there is tremendous reliance on the backstop in the latter years, e.g., hydrogen via photovoltaics and electrolysis. We note that this is but one example of a non electric backstop. In the spirit of Nordhaus (1979), “the costs of new unproven technologies must perforce be laden with uncertainty.” We have attempted to place an upper bound on the cost of carbon-free nonelectric energy that is available in unlimited quantities at constant marginal cost. There are a number of technologies drawing upon superabundant resources that might fit this description. Hence our example is only meant to be illustrative.",346.007643

We focus on the impact ofalternative assumptions about the rate ofenergy efficiency (EE) improvements (as measured in the model by the autonomous energy efficiency improvements, or AEEI, parameter), the future of nuclear and CCS generation, and the availability of sustainable biomass. In each case we construct a more optimistic (“high”) and a more pessimistic (“low”) variant, although we eschew judgment as to which is more realistic (see Table 1). These variants are combined into several scenarios in order to identify key sensitivities. Table 1 summarizes the technology scenarios. The most optimistic scenario is referred to as the Full Portfolio, and the most pessimistic as the Limited Portfolio. The other scenarios explore mixed alternatives. The table includes a column noting scenario numbers that correspond to particular technology configurations used in the overall EMF-27 Study (multiple scenario numbers refer to alternative policy cases). Our approach, following and extending the structure of the EMF27 exercise, is to examine each of the policy scenarios separately against each of the technology scenarios. However, in the case of the 2.8os W/m2 policy scenario, certain technology variants turn out to be critical for computing feasibility, so that in the more limited technology cases, the target cannot be met within the model’s standard parameterization. Specifically, for those cases where CCS is not available, the 2100 target is relaxed to 2.84 W/m2, although we continue to refer to it as a 2.8os W/m2 target in all cases (with overshoot).",345.925266

Here, Group 1 (primarily the wealthier countries that comprise the greater OECD) and Group 2 (their less economically developed counterparts) aim at a 50 % reduction of their combined emissions (CO2-eq) relative to 1990 by 2050. Group 1 agrees to strive for an 80 % reduction and Group 2, adopts an emission cap necessary to achieve the goal of 50 % reduction in combined Group 1 and 2 emissions. Emissions trading is permitted between Group 1 countries prior to 2020, and between Groups 1 and 2 countries from 2020 on. After 2050, reductions of 2 % per year of emissions from Group 1 and 2 countries are adopted for the remainder of the century. Group 3 (the fossil fuel resource owners in the Middle East and Russia) are assumed to have little incentive to participate in the coalition and remain unconstrained during the 21st century. We compare this to an alternative future called the Fragmented Policy (FP). Whereas the G8m scenario is based on aggressive, coordinated action, the FP scenario is designed to reflect heterogeneous national commitments of stringency more consistent with practical expectations about ability and willingness to pay. In this case, Group 1 adopts a cap of 50 % emissions reductions (CO2-eq) relative to 2005 in 2050. Emissions trading is permitted between Group 1 countries prior to 2020, After 2020, net emissions permit exports from Group II to Group I are limited to 20 % of the Group 1 mitigation requirement (i.e. the difference between baseline emissions and emissions allowances under the cap). After 2050, emissions are reduced by 2 % per year. Group 2 adopts emission constraints through 2020 corresponding to their Copenhagen pledges. After 2020, Group 2 countries make emissions reductions relative to their baseline based on their income. Once a Group 2 country reaches a specified income level, its emissions allowance is reduced by 2 % per year.

Thus, the two top-down policies differ both in terms of their 2100 target and whether overshoot is allowed. Allowing overshoot in the 2.8os policy is very important as a 2.8 W/m2 policy without overshoot is a significantly more stringent policy with substantial cost, and even infeasibility, implications (see, for instance, Clarke et al. 2009). The 2.8os W/m2 target is approximately equivalent to a 450 ppmv CO2-eq limit on atmospheric concentrations. The 3.7 W/m2 policy regime corresponds to limiting atmospheric concentrations to 550 CO2-eq, or approximately twice preindustrial levels.

Our analysis employs the MERGE model, a model for exploring regional and global effects of energy policy. MERGE is an Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) that provides a reduced-form description of the economy, the energy sector, emissions, concentrations, radiative forcing and average temperature change. For a range of assumptions, with MERGE we are able to identify the least-cost mix of technologies for meeting a climate objective. Like virtually all models being actively used in the climate debate, MERGE is continually being adapted to assess the implications ofnew policy proposals. Among the most noteworthy enhancements to the current version is the inclusion of BECS, bio-energy with carbon dioxide capture and geologic storage. By storing CO2 from the combustion ofbiomass feedstocks, this technology could result in “negative” CO2 emissions into the atmosphere. When used in sufficient quantities it could substantially offset the warming attributed to fossil fuel use. However, there are as of yet unresolved questions related to the availability of biomass and CCS that must be resolved before we can truly know the full potential of BECS. A brief description of MERGE and its numerical assumptions can be found in appendix 1. Ours is a cost-effectiveness, not a benefit-cost analysis. We examine the impacts ofmeeting various stabilization targets in terms ofGDP foregone—where GDP losses are measured solely in terms ofthe “dead-weight” losses associated with reducing emissions. We do not attempt to calculate the reduction in damages brought about by a particular policy. To the extent we consider benefits; it is in terms ofthe reduction in temperature change associated with reducing emissions. 1 We begin by describing the scenarios and their underlying assumptions. They are designed to address the following questions: What would happen, ifbecause ofrisk aversion or technical challenges, nuclear power is tightly constrained and/or CCS is unavailable? How might substantial improvements in energy efficiency affect the costs of meeting a target? What are the benefits of breakthroughs in the costs and availability of biomass? For extremely tight targets, what are the benefits and costs of allowing overshoot?

Mitigation is measured in terms of GDP foregone. This is not a benefit-cost analysis. No attempt is made to calculate the reduction in damages brought about by a particular policy. Assumptions are varied regarding the availability of energy-producing and energy-using technologies. We find pathways with substantial reductions in temperature change, with the cost of reductions varying significantly, depending on policy and technology assumptions. The set of scenarios elucidates the potential energy system transformation demands that could be placed on society. We find that policy that allows for “overshoot” of a radiative forcing target during the century results in lower costs, but also a higher temperature at the end of the century. We explore the implications of the costs and availability of key mitigation technologies, including carbon capture and storage (CCS), bioenergy, and their combination, known as BECS, as well as nuclear and energy efficiency. The role of “negative emissions” via BECS in particular is examined. Finally, we demonstrate the implications of nationally adopted emissions timetables based on articulated goals as a counterpoint to a global stabilization approach.",345.864794

(Its C1 scenario is similar to the B1 scenario presented here; an alternative development including a higher nuclear contribution from a new generation of smaller scale modular reactor designs is outlined in scenario C2 [5]). 25 To identify whether a technology is contributing at a specific point in time, we use a threshold of 5% of the total annual mitigation or a share of 30% of the mitigation potential of the respective technology cluster.

That negative values indicate exceedance of carbon sinks (natural and via CSS) over emissions. See the electronic version of this paper for colored figures. 16 In our analysis we consider also a variety of different technological add-on options for carbon capture and storage (CCS) during energy conversion processes. For fossil-based CCS systems in the power sector we adopt published cost assumptions [23,24] with an average efficiency of 90% of the removal process. Capital requirements for CCS range from 940 US$/kWh for coal-based pre-combustion CCS systems to less than 510 US$/kWh for post-combustion (gasification) processes. The associated energy penalties (conversion losses) range from 13 to 25%. In addition, for biomass-based CCS systems (BECS) we assume limited initial up-scaling potential for energy conversion plants during the next three decades. Thereafter, plant sizes of 100–200 MWe are assumed to become available. The costs of BECS are assumed to be about 30–70% higher than those of equivalent large-scale coal-based CCS systems [24]. The cost for CO2 transportation and storage are based on published estimates [25], which report a range for the costs of storing CO2 in deep saline aquifers or depleted oil or gas fields between 3.7 and 11 US$/tC. For our calculations we adopted the mean value of this range, which corresponds to 7.3 US$/tC. For transportation of captured CO2 from the sources to the reservoirs, we used a cost range of 3.7–11 US$/tC/100 km [25]. For our scenario calculations, we retained the mean value of these estimates and assumed an average pipeline length of 250 km, assuming that CO2 is transported in the liquid state, which corresponds to 18.3 US$/tC/250 km. We consider also that a large share of biomass power plants will be located in relative closer proximity to the biomass supply than the prospective storage sites. Thus, CO2 from BECS has to be transported over larger distances than CO2 from fossil power plants. Costs of CO2 transportation are assumed to be higher than those from coal by a factor of more than two.",454.249

Afforestation has been identified as a comparatively low-cost option to sequester carbon, but side-effects of afforestation at large-scale were so far not much in the focus. Afforestation will, if it competes with food production for the same areas, lead to an increase in food prices. Moreover, as previous research has shown, afforestation in high latitudes will likely only have a small cooling effect on the global average temperature, or could even increase it, because of the counteracting albedo warming effect. Our study confirms that afforestation offers a high potential for carbon dioxide removal, and more than 860 Gt of CO2 are sequestered in our unrestricted afforestation scenario up to the end of the century. However, we also find that this afforestation leads to a more than fourfold increase in food prices by 2100. When afforestation is restricted to the tropics—and thus the albedo warming effect avoided—still substantial carbon sequestration can be achieved. This, at the same time, lowers global food prices substantially which nevertheless remain increased in tropical regions compared to a world without large-scale forest expansion. Our study suggests that a liberalisation of agricultural trade could further dampen the remaining price increases in tropical regions. By sequestering carbon though afforestation, tropical regions would offer a valuable service for the benefit of the whole world. An international carbon market for carbon credits could be the source of monetary flows to those tropical countries under-taking afforestation and could compensate for some of the disadvantages coming along with it. Thoughtfully designed policies would have to avoid that established forests are cut down again and release the carbon stored. The raised money should also be used for investments into agricultural R&D, to achieve necessary rates of yield increase. And lastly, policies should be designed in a way which assures that not only land-owner profit, but revenues are also distributed to those people affected most by the food price increases. We conclude from our study that afforestation should not be seen as the silver bullet ofclimate change mitigation, but set in the right context and done at the right location it can well be a complement to other mitigation options.",434.6903

In the coming decades, a growing global population is expected to increase the demand for food, in particular for livestock products (Alexandratos and Bruinsma 2012, Bodirsky et al 2015). This, together with a likely elevated demand for bioenergy, will increase the total demand for agricultural products. These long-term trends are overlain by a number ofmore short-term factors affecting prices, such as weather variability, financial speculation or restrictive export policies in response to increasing prices (Mueller et al 2011). Lagi et al (2015), for instance, were able to replicate the FAO food price index between 2004 and 2012 with a dynamic model, where the underlying upward trend was due to an increasing demand for ethanol production, while the short-term peaks were caused by speculation. Our model is designed to capture the medium-term to long-term drivers of food price formation, and reveals the relative difference between afforestation scenarios and a world without forest-based climate mitigation. It does not consider specific policies and drivers on local or short time scale. Food demand was provided exogenously to the model as a function of per capita income and population. Since price hikes in the afforestation scenarios were quite high with respect to the BAU case, it could be expected that the consumption of agricultural products declines, in spite of relatively low demand-to-price elasticises of food products, especially in high income countries (Hertel 2011, Muhammad et al 2011). Also for this reason, MAgPIE represented the upper range of food price estimates when climate change effects were assessed in a model intercomparison (Nelson et al 2014). However, we also assumed that currently developing regions become relatively wealthy towards the end ofthe century when food prices are projected to be at the highest level, which would result in lower shares ofincome expenditure on food and low demand elasticities. Afforestation at the scale as described in this study would imply macro-economic effects that should be subject to further research, for instance within a general equilibrium framework. The MAgPIE model is a partial equilibrium model of the agricultural sector, impacts of afforestation on other sectors of the economy such as labour, capital and carbon markets were therefore not part of this study. We would expect that increasing food prices also increase the income of net food sellers, and reduce the incomes of net buyers as non-food expenditures are reduced, which could in consequence change the demand for food (Dorward 2012). Afforestation might also create new jobs in the short term for the planting of trees, but these jobs would vanish once the forests are established. Rent-seeking behaviour and opportunities to invest in land under a policy rewarding carbon removal could substantially shift production input factors from other sectors. Furthermore, our analysis of trade was focused on the agricultural sector. For the only tro ical afforestation scenario we assessed how trade liberalisation would influence regional food prices. We have, for instance, not considered how the consequential change in trade flows (e.g. increased imports of livestock products to Africa) would have to be compensated by trade flows in other sectors to avoid trade deficits, or how trade liberalisation would affect economies in general. Finally, the creation of an international market for carbon credits could create a substantial flow of money from CO2-emitting countries to those actively sequestering carbon through afforestation. These revenues could be used to finance, among other things, the import offood.",434.04559

For this study we assumed the GDP development of the SSP2 scenario (Dellink et al 2015), which is steadily increasing for all model regions, and is also the basis for the increased per capita demand for food products. In most regions the rates ofGDP increase are higher or in the same range as the price increases due to afforestation, so that share of expenditure for food would stay constant or decrease for a representative agent (see figure S5). Still, increases in wealth would not necessarily be distributed evenly among the population, so that the change in prices reported here could still have drastic impacts on the poorer parts of society. This is especially true for people whose share of expenditure on food is currently quite high, such as the poorest people in some African and Asian countries who currently expend above 70% of their available income on food (FAO 2015a).",212.17148

In our study this happened as soon as there was a price on CO2 emissions from deforestation. At the moment, however, no such policy is in place on a global level and much of the carbon stored in tropical forests is released into the atmosphere. Gross carbon emissions from tropical regions were estimated to be around 0.81 GtC yr−1 between 2000 and 2005 (Harris et al 2012), with yearly emissions of deforestation from the Amazon basin alone accounting for 0.18 GtC between 2000 and 2010 (Song et al 2015). The current trend is opposite to what we described in our only tro ical afforestation scenario. Between 1993 and 2012 tropical forests lost above-ground biomass carbon (−0.21 GtC yr−1), while boreal and temperate forests gained it by about the same amount (+0.18 GtC yr−1) (Liu et al 2015). However, Brazil—the country with the greatest absolute forest area reduction—has recently reduced its deforestation curve through conservation policies and stricter law enforcement on the ground (Assunção et al 2015, Tollefson 2015, FAO 2015b). China has initiated a large afforestation programme, with plans to increase afforested area by 40 Mha by 2020, a measure which was found not only to sequester carbon but also to decrease local land-surface temperatures (Peng et al 2014). And in December 2015, ten African countries launched AFR100, and initiative to restore 100 Mha of degraded and deforested land by 2030— partly as a climate change mitigation measure (WRI 2015). These developments are just few ofmany that indicate that global afforestation efforts now have better prospects for success. Continuous yield increases and substantial investment into yield-increasing R&D would be needed to fulfil the food demands ofa growing population, especially when agriculture competes with afforestation. The high price on CO2 emissions, and hence the strong incentive to free up agricultural land for afforestation, initiates continuous yield-increasing technological change in our study, with values well above those observed historically. In contrast to other partial equilibrium land-use models (e.g. GLOBIOM: Kraxner etal 2013, GCAM: Calvin et al 2014), technological change is endogenously derived within MAgPIE (Dietrich et al 2014, Von Lampe et al 2014), and yields tend to increase stronger in response to additional pressures on the land-use system (Lotze-Campen et al 2014, Nelson et al 2014, Delincé et al 2015). During recent decades, yields of main staple crops increased linearly at average rates of 1% (wheat, rice, soybean) and 1.5% (maize), while the relative annual rate of increase constantly dropped (Fischer et al 2014). Increased investment into R&D would be needed to make afforestation a realistic option, but when research spending increased in recent years this was largely driven by the development in single countries like China and India. Almost every third OECD country actually had a negative trend in public agricultural R&D spending. And in the developing world, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, where in our afforestation scenarios yields more than tripled between 2010 and 2100, public spending on agricultural R&D amounted to only about 1.6 billion US$ or 5% of global agricultural R&D spending in 2008, and almost halfthe African countries had a negative trend in their budgets (Beintema et al 2012). This trend of low R&D spending would certainly have to turn around in order to achieve the yields projected in our model. The yield increases triggered by afforestation could also alter agricultural N2O and CH4 emissions, a dynamic that was not in the focus of this study. Intensification could both increase or decrease N2O emissions from soils, depending on whether intensification is reached through higher inputs (e.g. fertilizer) or better agronomic practices (Bodirsky and Müller 2014, Lassaletta et al 2014). CH4 emissions from the livestock sector would likely be decreased by intensification due to a more efficient feed conversion (Herrero et al 2013).",433.74219

In our study, these food price increases were the consequence of a large-scale transformation of the land-use sector, where food has to be produced on a much smaller overall agricultural area. In the scenario of unrestricted afforestation, cropland area is reduced by almost half to a global value of about 800 Mha in 2100, and pasture shrinks by more than 50% to about 1465 Mha, values that were last observed at around the year 1900 (Klein Goldewijk et al 2011). This decline in agricultural areas is enabled by significant investments into yield-increasing technological change and comes along with a pronounced increase in food prices. Avoided deforestation alone does not drastically spike food prices, which is in line with an earlier study by Schneider et al (2011). The finding that afforestation drives up food prices is also the result of a previous study by Calvin et al (2014), in which afforestation was also incentivized by a price on emissions from land-use, and resulted in increasing wheat prices. In contrast to this study, we report a combined food price index for meat and food-crop products for different afforestation scenarios. We also compare food prices under afforestation to a scenario where emissions from land use are priced, which leads to avoided deforestation. This comparison shows that most of the price increase can in fact be attributed to afforestation, while the emissions pricing alone is of lesser importance. Limiting afforestation to the tropics—where it is most effective in decreasing global temperatures –sub-stantially reduces the impact on food prices. Earlier studies with earth system models showed that afforestation in the tropics, through the combined effect of carbon sequestration and albedo change, leads to a net cooling, while planting trees in the boreal zone might even increase global temperatures (Bala et al 2007, Bathiany et al 2010, Arora and Montenegro 2011). While this simplified, latitudinal dependence seems to hold true in general, exceptions are possible under specific site conditions. Since historical boreal and tropical deforestation took place on the most productive lands with above-average carbon stocks and below-average snow cover, a reforestation of some boreal areas might also decrease global temperatures (Pongratz et al 2011). And an afforestation of tropical and subtropical desert areas could result in net warming because of the prevalence of the albedo effect (Keller et al 2014). Desert areas with high albedo, however, were not considered for afforestation in our study. Rather, afforestation was restricted to agricultural areas in certain latitudinal zones, excluding boreal and temperate zones where afforestation might not show a global cooling effect. Integrating the albedo-induced radiative forcing effect of afforestation directly in the model, as has been done by Jones et al (2015), should be considered for future model applications.",434.71305

Latin America turns from an exporter of food commodities into a net importer towards the end of the century. Africa further increases its imports of livestock products, which are mostly supplied by North America. In 2075, the year in which prices are highest globally, food prices are reduced by more than 25% in Latin America and Africa (figure 4). In Pacific Asia, where food prices are highest in 2100, the price index changes from 400 to 219. Subsequent price increases in Europe are negligible. While trade liberalisation has a strong influence on prices, it does not decrease afforested area (1275 Mha) or the sequestered amount ofcarbon (552 Gt).",211.33966

In the BAU scenario, without any pricing ofemissions from the land-use system, food prices are projected to stay rather constant, or to decrease slightly to about 10% lower than in 2010 (figure 2(b)), caused by a decline in demand towards the end ofthe century (figure S2). The exponentially increasing CO2 price on land-use-changes emission in the avoided deforestation scenario prevents the conversion of pasture and forest to cropland. Increasing land scarcity and the necessary investment costs for research and development increase prices at maximum by about 40% on global average in this case. Afforestation leads to competition for land between carbon sequestration and agricultural production and results in substantial food price increases. Under unrestricted afforestation food prices increase by about 80% up to 2050 and are on average more than four times higher in 2100 than in 2010. Excluding boreal regions from afforestation reduces this effect only by about 9% in 2100. However, when afforestation is limited to the zone of highest cooling effectiveness— the tropics—the food price impact is significantly reduced. In the only tro ical afforestation scenario, food prices peak in 2075 having increased by about 100%, followed by a decline in prices due to decreasing demand for food at times of high agricultural yields and a slowdown of forest expansion. Especially in the unrestricted and no boreal scenarios, the additional land-use competition through afforestation influences prices much more strongly than the mere effect of emission pricing in the avoided deforestation scenario. Food prices are also sensitive to the CO2 price. Lower CO2 prices lead to lower carbon sequestration, but also reduce food prices (figure S9). Food prices in different regions are affected differ-ently by the modelled afforestation scenarios (figure 3). Unrestricted afforestation leads to the highest prices of all scenarios over the century within all regions, with the highest values occurring in Pacific Asia (PAS: 630) and Latin America (LAM: 640). In the Former Soviet Union (FSU) the increase is lowest, with prices three times higher in 2100. Excluding the boreal zone from afforestation leads to lower food commodity prices than unrestricted afforestation, especially in regions that are partly in the boreal zone. In Europe (EUR) and FSU estimated food prices in 2100 are then about 30% lower. FSU turns into a net exporter ofcrops, EUR into a net exporter of livestock products towards the end of the century (figures S6 and S7), which also influences food prices in other regions. In Africa (AFR) and LAM, prices are 7% lower in the no boreal than in the unrestricted scenario in 2100, even though afforested area differs by less than 1% (see also figure 1). Limiting afforestation to the tropical zone results in a food price index much closer to the BAU scenario, and much lower than for unrestricted and no boreal afforestation, but in tropical regions the price increases are still substantial. In Pacific Asia the food price index is highest in 2100 with a value of 400, while in Latin America the maximum index level of 219 is reached in 2070. The influence on temperate and boreal regions is much lower. In EUR, NAM and FSU the price indices are at maximum increased by 35% to 40% compared to the BAU case. In this scenario, food price increases are in all regions lower than the assumed increase in GDP (figure S5).",434.6964

While in the BAU case more than 90 Gt of CO2 are released as a result ofland-use change, up to 860 Gt CO2 are sequestered in the case of unrestricted afforestation between 2010 and 2100. The pricing of CO2 emissions from land-use change in the avoided deforestation scenario results in no net release of carbon from the land-use system. Restricting afforestation to non-boreal and tropical regions reduces the area and therefore the amount of carbon sequestered (figure 2(a)). For the no boreal scenario carbon removal is 8%, and the afforested area about 13% lower globally compared to the unrestricted scenario. In the only tro ical afforestation scenario, terrestrial carbon uptake is about 40% lower than in the unrestricted scenario, while afforestation area is reduced by about 50%.

Globally, cropland area increases by 360 million hectares (Mha) until 2100, leading to a reduction ofthe area ofpasture by 275 Mha and offorests and other natural vegetation by about 85 Mha. The introduction of a price on CO2 emissions from land-use change stops the net conversion of forest to agricultural areas on a global level. In the avoided deforestation scenario, cropland expands by 77 Mha, with most of the change happening in Africa (40 Mha) at the expense of pasture (17 Mha) and forest (13 Mha), while in Europe there is some regrowth offorests (14 Mha). In the afforestation scenarios the CO2 price provides an incentive for afforestation so that forest area increases substantially in all regions where this option was given considering the latitudinal restrictions. Under unrestricted afforestation, more than 2500 million ha are newly afforested globally between 2010 and 2100, which is equivalent to an increase ofglobal forest area by more than 60%. The largest areas of afforestation in absolute terms are in Africa (630 Mha) and Latin America (600 Mha), but afforestation is also substantial in all other regions when compared to their total land areas (figure 1). While in most regions afforestation leads mainly to a reduction in pasture, in Europe and Pacific Asia more croplands are converted to grow forests. The restriction to no boreal afforestation reduces the afforested area by about 13% globally, but hardly changes the amount of land conversion in tropical regions. In the only tro ical afforestation scenario, in contrast, the area of forest establishment is cut by half (table 1). While it remains at comparable levels in the tropical regions Africa and Pacific Asia it is lower in Latin America (435 Mha), because areas in the south (>20°S) were not considered for afforestation (figure S9). While in the BAU scenario investments into yield-increasing R&D are rather modest, the introduction of a price on CO2 emissions prevents further agricultural expansion and necessitates higher yields in the avoided deforestation scenario. In the afforestation scenarios, pasture and cropland area decrease globally, which results in even more substantial yield increases needed to fulfil food demands (table 1). Throughout the afforestation scenarios, the highest rates ofyield-increasing technological change are seen in 2020, when the pricing policy on land-use emissions is implemented. These rates are, especially in the tropical regions, substantially higher than those observed in the recent past (Fischer et al 2014). Until the end of the century average annual technological change rates range between 0.44% in BAU and 1.34% in the unrestricted afforestation scenario. Large regional differences are observed, with yields being about 5.5 times as high in Africa at the end of the century in the unrestricted case compared to 2010, but less than double within Europe in the same scenario (see figure S8 for regional yield development).",211.1563

To assess the food price effects of afforestation under differing levels of ability to decrease global temperatures, we considered three scenarios where afforestation was limited to certain latitudinal zones. Within these areas the decision to afforest was based on its cost-effective-ness under a CO2 price on land-use emissions. The effect ofalbedo was not included directly in the model, but scenarios with different influence on albedo-induced radiative forcing were assessed. In the first scenario afforestation was not restricted at all (unrestricted aff), in the second not allowed in the boreal zone north of50°N (no boreal aff), and finally it was limited to the tropical zone between 20°S and 20°N (only tro ical aff). The definition of tropical and boreal zones thereby follows Bala et al (2007). These afforestation scenarios were compared to a scenario of avoided deforestation, where terrestrial CO2 emissions were also priced but no afforestation was considered, and to a business as usual (BAU) case without any emissions pricing (see also table 1). While limiting large-scale afforestation to the tropics seems plausible from a climate mitigation perspective, it could still result in severe food price hikes in tropical regions. Enhanced international trade of agricultural commodities could be one option to buffer these price increases in tropical regions. For the only tro ical aff case we therefore assessed how more liberalised trade influenced food prices (only tro ical aff tradelib). In this scenario, trade departed more quickly from historical agricultural trade patterns towards more international trade based on comparative advantages. While in our default setting the influence ofhistorical trade patterns decreased by 0.5% per year, in this scenario it was reduced by 1% per year (see also figure S4). For these scenarios we calculated Laspeyres food price indices that comprise vegetable and livestock products. The Laspeyres formula weights prices according to base year quantities and is also the common approach used, for instance, by The World Bank (2015) to calculate its consumer price index. Food prices derived from MAgPIE reflect the marginal costs of food production (shadow prices), i.e. the costs that would arise for the production of one additional commodity unit. They are formed as a consequence of altered demand and production costs and therefore show the relative long-term commodity price development. Food prices in the BAUscenario are driven by the increasing demand for food from a growing and wealthier population. In the avoided deforestation scenario food prices additionally reflect the pricing of land-use-change emissions, the thus reduced attractiveness to reduce the area offorest or convert pastures to cropland, and the increased need to invest into yield-increasing technology. Food prices in the afforestation scenarios are the result of all these factors and an additional reward on carbon uptake through afforestation which leads to decreasing agricultural areas.",212.17354

MAgPIE is an agro-economic land-use model that minimises the global costs of agricultural production for a given agricultural demand under a set of economic and biophysical constraints. By this it computes optimal, spatially explicit future land-use patterns in five-year time steps. Agricultural demand in the model is based on projections of future population and gross domestic product (GDP) of the SSP2 scenario (KC and Lutz 2014, Dellink et al 2015, O’Neill et al 2015). This scenario assumes that global population peaks in 2070 at 9.4 billion people, while per capita GDP continues to increase until 2100. Future demand for calories and livestock share in consumption are derived through a regression model that has been estimated with historical data for calories consumed and GDP development (Bodirsky et al 2015) (see also figures S2 and S3). Feed demand for livestock production results from animalspecific feed baskets (Weindl et al 2010, 2015). Socioeconomic parameters, such as the demand, are exogenously fed into the model at the level of ten geo-economic world regions. The model considers the production of 17 different crop groups and 5 livestock commodities. Bioenergy production was not included in this study. Potential crop yields, carbon densities and water availabilities are derived by the Dynamic Global Vegetation Model LPJmL (Bondeau et al 2007, Fader et al 2010, Waha etal 2012, Müller and Robertson 2014) on a spatial resolution of 0.5°. For the starting year of the model (1995) crop yields were calibrated to match attained country yield levels and regional production areas reported by FAOSTAT. For an efficient, non-linear modelling under computational constraints, spatial input data were aggregated to 600 clusters with similar crop yields, hydrological conditions and market access (Dietrich et al 2013). In the model there are several options to respond to future changes in demand or other pressures on the land-use system, such as afforestation. The land-use pattern can react flexibly so that one land-use class can be extended at the expense ofothers, e.g. cropland can be expanded onto former pasture areas, or afforestation might take place on present-day croplands. The model can also reallocate production to locations that are more productive, domestically within a region or via international trade. Another option implemented is the use ofirrigation. Finally, agricultural production can be intensified by endogenous investment decisions in yield-increasing technological change. Agricultural production and all options to increase production are associated with costs. Factor costs account for costs related to capital, labour and fertilizer use and were derived from the GTAP database (Narayanan and Walmsley 2008). The change from one land-use class to another is subject to regionally differing land conversion costs (Schmitz 2012). Yield increases induced by technological change are endogenous in MAgPIE and are connected to additional investment costs for Research & Development (R&D). These costs were derived through a regression between historical investments and observed yield increases (Dietrich et al 2014). An investment horizon of 30 years and a discount rate of 7% are assumed for all investment decisions. Starting from the present distribution of areas equipped for irrigation (Siebert et al 2007), the model can increase irrigated areas at investment costs for the creation of the infrastructure and costs for operation and maintenance (Bonsch et al 2016). The cost effectiveness of production is also influenced by intraregional transport costs which make production at locations far from markets more expensive. Food commodities can be traded between the world regions. Two trade pools are implemented in the model. Within the first trade pool, trade flows are fixed to fulfil regional, historically observed self-suffi-ciency rates calculated from FAOSTAT (2010). For the following time steps, the influence of this first trade pool is reduced depending on the scenario, and food commodities are to a larger share traded according to regional comparative advantages (Schmitz et al 2012) (figure S4). Afforestation and avoided deforestation are incentivized by a price on CO2 emissions from the land system. While the CO2 price renders deforestation and the conversion ofpasture to cropland more costly, carbon dioxide removal through afforestation is rewarded and lowers the costs in the objective function of the model. Afforestation is implemented as induced regrowth of natural vegetation. Carbon accumulation in living biomass follows sigmoidal tree growth curves where the upper limit is defined by carbon densities from the LPJmL model. Soil and litter carbon densities are assumed to increase linearly over 20 years, starting from the weighted average carbon density of cropland and pasture (Humpenöder et al 2014, 2015). For this study we assumed a CO2 price that starts at 30 US$ per tonne of CO2 in 2020 and increases by 5% each year (similar to Calvin etal 2012 and Kriegler et al 2013).",434.71083

Yet simply reducing GHG emissions might not be sufficient, or might only be achievable at high cost, so that carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere (CDR) could become necessary in the second half of the century. Accordingly, most scenarios of the fifth assessment report of the IPCC (AR5) that are consistent with the 2 °C target include negative net CO2 emissions (Clarke et al 2014, Fuss et al 2014). This is also acknowledged in the recent Paris Agreement of the UNFCCC, in which parties agreed to aim for a balance between anthropogenic emissions and sinks of GHGs in the second half of the century (UNFCCC 2015). Land-based mitigation strategies such as afforestation and avoided deforestation could make important contributions to achieving this target (Smith et al 2014). Afforestation offers a high carbon sequestration potential at moderate cost, and could therefore become an alternative to or could complement other mitigation options. Cost estimates for afforestation are lower than for other carbon removal technologies such as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) and by an order ofmagnitude lower than for direct air capture (Smith et al 2015). Strengers et al (2008) calculated supply curves of afforestation on abandoned agricultural land and found that in 2075 more than 50% of the overall potential could be supplied at costs of less than 200 $/tC, which is relatively cheap compared to other mitigation options. Edmonds et al (2013) showed that a 2 °C warming at the end of the century would be possible without BECCS, but would require substantial carbon sequestration through afforestation, especially if mitigation action is delayed in some countries. Calvin et al (2014) illustrated that afforestation is an economically attractive option. When in their study a carbon tax consistent with limiting radiative forcing to 3.7 W m−2 was applied to the energy and land-use system, global forest area increased by about 20%. Humpenöder et al (2014) found that a reward for terrestrial carbon uptake could provide an incentive for large-scale afforestation, resulting in cumulative removal ofmore than 700 Gt CO2 by 2095. With such a huge potential, afforestation could play a considerable part in climate change mitigation efforts. On the downside, large-scale afforestation might lead to a considerable increase in food prices through increasing competition for land between forest and agricultural production. Similar concerns have been raised in the past with regard to first-generation biofuel production, but the demand for biofuel was only one factor ofmany that contributed to food price hikes in recent years and its contribution was estimated to be rather modest (Mueller et al 2011, Persson 2015). Similarly, a model intercomparison study showed that second-generation bioenergy production consistent with the 2 °C target could result in rather moderate food price increases up to 2050 ifthe land available for the expansion of agriculture were not restricted and if necessary investments into technology and development (R&D) were anticipated (Lotze-Campen et al 2014). Afforestation, however, may need substantially more area to achieve a similar level ofcarbon dioxide removal to BECCS (Humpenöder et al 2014), and could therefore have a much stronger influence on land-use competition. Bioenergy crops are harvested regularly, while once established, forests need to be maintained also under declining carbon accumulation rates ifthe carbon is to remain stored. Wise et al (2009) found that a carbon tax on terrestrial and industrial emissions could lead to an expansion of managed forests but also to a more than doubling ofcorn prices. In a study by Reilly et al (2012) a price on land carbon emissions created an incentive to reforest but also increased food prices. Calvin et al (2014) assessed the effect of afforestation with the integrated assessment model GCAM and found that wheat prices increased to 320% in 2095 compared to 2005 values. The effectiveness of afforestation for climate mitigation differs depending on the location, making its application unfavourable in some regions. This is because establishing forests leads to two effects that often have an opposing influence on the average global temperature. On the one hand, while growing, trees take up carbon from the atmosphere and store it in their biomass (biogeochemical effect). On the other hand, changing land-cover to trees also affects the amount of short-wave radiation reflected back to space (biogeophysical effect), directly by surface albedo and indirectly by the contribution to cloud formation. This biogeophysical effect varies as a function of latitude (Bonan 2008). Several studies with earth system models have shown that an expansion offorest in the tropics results in cooling, while afforestation in the boreal zone might have only a limited effect or might even result in global warming (Bala et al 2007, Bathiany et al 2010, Arora and Montenegro 2011). Bright (2015) and Bright et al (2015) provide a good overview over the biogeochemical and biophysical processes that affect global and local temperatures as a consequence ofland-cover and management change. In the study presented here, we assessed global and regional food price impacts oflarge-scale afforestation with the Model of Agricultural Production and its Impacts on the Environment (MAgPIE). Earlier studies, using similar methods, have assessed bioenergy potentials (van Vuuren et al 2009, Erb et al 2012), requirements for and consequences of forest and biodiversity protection (Kraxner et al 2013, Overmars et al 2014, Erb et al 2016) or estimated climate change impacts on food prices (Delincé et al 2015). Five scenarios were analysed, one in which a CO2 price on land-use-change emissions avoids deforestation and three where the CO2 price created an additional incentive for afforestation. In these cases afforestation was either unrestricted, prevented in the boreal zone, or limited to the tropical zone. These scenarios were compared to a business-as-usual case without emission pricing. As afforestation was expected to increase food prices, we furthermore assessed whether more liberalised trade conditions could have an alleviating effect on food prices.",433.94687

Overall, the carbon cycle model in DICE2016R has significantly improved compared to DICE2013R, capturing very well long-term outgassing of carbon injected into the deep ocean and corresponding increases in the temperature beyond 2500 for large CDR scenarios. Comparing DICE2016R to UVIC ESCM simulations indicates that the improved long-term dynamics come at the cost of a (too) tight short-term remaining emission budget. Ignoring other abatement options with respect to land-use emissions and non-CO2 greenhouse gases, compliance with the 2∘C goal cannot be achieved in DICE2016R without CDR. Consequently, one could argue that short-term mitigation policies derived with DICE2016R are too restrictive, however, in a cost-benefit framework the rather restrictive carbon cycle model is overcompensated by the modest estimates for climate change impacts in DICE2016R. Furthermore, the match between DICE2016R and UVic ESCM is closer for the atmospheric carbon content than for the global mean temperature increase, suggesting that adjustments of the climate module could be a strategy for achieving better estimates for mitigation policies.",394.06268

While cost-effective compliance with the 2∘C target requires significant CDR application already before the year 2050, application of CDR in a cost-benefit framework (with an endogenous amount of climate change) is a long-term strategy to speed up the otherwise rather slow natural reduction of the atmospheric carbon concentration after the peak in atmospheric temperature. In turn, near-term application of CDR goes in line with a strong substitution effect, resulting in less emission reductions. For this mode of application, the main effect of CDR is to extend the near-term emission budget, as only a very small or even zero emission can still be emitted to the atmosphere without CDR. Using CDR to bring down the atmospheric carbon content in the long-term incurred only a moderate substitution effect. The magnitude of these effects is dependent on the carbon cycle feedbacks in the applied carbon cycle model. For a model that assumes a rather slow exchange between the carbon reservoirs, oceanic CDR is close to “perfect” storage. This makes CDR very effective and results in turn in a strong substitution effect. For a model that assumes a fast exchange between the carbon reservoirs, oceanic CDR becomes less effective, resulting in a weaker substitution effect. However, decreased effectiveness of CDR results in extra CDR efforts to compensate for the carbon leaking back to the atmosphere ifthe CDR cost function is sufficiently flat. Consequently, modeling the effectiveness of CDR in dependence of the carbon cycle explicitly, results in different results than obtained by adjusting simply the effectiveness of CDR as in Chen and Tavoni (2013).",395.2155

So far, the investigation of these interactions and the net contribution of CDR has been mainly restricted to scenario analysis in Earth system models, which cannot answer how the presence of these feedbacks affects endogenously derived optimal or cost-effective mitigation policies. Consequently, the aim of our study was to investigate how well these feedbacks and effects are captured in IAMs, which are suitable to analyze a broad set of possible CDR scenarios. We have investigated (oceanic) CDR in the IAM DICE, in its most recent version (DICE2016R) and considered in addition two further carbon cycle models (DICE2013R and Gerlagh & Liski, 2017). We have considered three different mitigation frameworks, cost-benefit-analysis, compliance with the 2∘C goal, and cost-effective compliance with the 2∘C goal by the year 2100. In contrast to the literature, we did not imposed annual limits on the amount of CDR but considered a convex CDR cost function, as we believe that the operational cost are characterized by increasing marginal costs, both within any specific CDR method and across CDR methods.",394.37203

Introducing uncertainty in the climate system would have allowed us to investigate to which extend CDR is used to increase the likelihood of compliance with the 2∘C goal by for example a less pronounced substitution effect. Introducing uncertainty with respect to the carbon intensity and the development of the backstop price would also have implications for the application of CDR and the corresponding substitution effect. However, also the CDR methods themselves are uncertain with respect to their costs, their side-effects, and their carbon cycle implications (Field & Mach, 2017; Fuss et al., 2014). In particular CDR specific (uncertain) side-effects could limit their applications. The magnitude of the side-effects depends on the material cycles affected and the scale of application (Klepper & Rickels, 2014). Furthermore, the formation of CO2 plumes or lakes and the potential risk of fast rising CO2 bubbles (both potentially resulting from deep sea carbon injection) was neglected (Bigalke et al., 2008; IPCC, 2005). Despite no explicit treatment of uncertainty, our analysis of oceanic storage under the false assumption of perfect storage provides some insights. At least for CC16 and CC13 we can conclude that appropriate updating of the information on carbon stock levels reduces the misguidance from neglecting potential uncertainties about carbon cycle feedbacks.",394.0393

Furthermore, many processes relevant for different CDR methods are not included, implying that our generic treatment of CDR may be too coarse to study details of specific CDR methods. For example, termination of alkalinity management is expect to result in smaller outgassing of removed carbon than termination of macro- or micronutrient fertilization and would rather correspond to the perfect storage scenario in our investigation than oceanic CDR (Keller et al., 2014; Paquay & Zeebe, 2013). However, if alkalinity increase would be achieved by spreading olivine (e.g., in the catchment area of large rivers) also nutrient cycles would be affected, resulting in additional fertilization effects, making the estimation of the actual net removal (after termination) more complex than suggested by the basic ocean chemistry (Köhler et al., 2013). Still, even under the assumption of perfect storage for alkalinity management, opposing carbon cycle feedbacks would be at play, resulting from the response of the terrestrial carbon reservoir (which is captured in our investigation by reduced ambient carbon uptake of the upper box for CC13 and CC16 and reduced uptake of the terrestrial biosphere in CCGL).",394.05802

Introducing abatement options for land-use emissions and non-CO2 emissions (non-CO2 forcing is assumed in DICE2016R to be linearly increasing from 0.5 W/m2 in the year 2015 to 1 W/m2 in the year 2100 and constant thereafter) allow simulations that comply with the 2∘C or even 1.5∘C goal without CDR (Su et al., 2017). Furthermore, the substitution effect is strongly dependent on the assumptions in DICE2016R with respect to the exogenous development of the carbon intensity and the backstop price. With less optimistic assumptions in this regard, we would observe a much stronger substitution effect also in the cost-benefit framework. While the magnitude of the substitution effect influences the magnitude of the outgassing and temperature increase beyond the year 2500, both are not inevitable outcomes of CDR policies obtained from the DICE2016R model. We have derived the optimal polices only until the year 2500 (the DICE2016R specification) and simulated the response of the carbon cycle model for the remaining 1500 years under the assumption of zero emissions and zero CDR. The purpose was to investigate to which extent the carbon cycle models used in integrated assessment capture stylized facts of the carbon cycle. Extending the optimization period would result in continuous CDR to remove carbon from the atmosphere and pump it into the deep ocean at the rate at which it leaks back to the atmosphere. Due to discounting, such continuous long-term CDR application would, however, have negligible effects on near-term policies.",395.19618

An important model limitation in this respect is a coarse grid resolution, which for example prevents the correct representation of bottom water formation processes on the continental shelf and thus might favor such events (Bernardello et al., 2014).

In particular simulated atmospheric carbon content is rather similar in CC16 and UVIC, at least until the year 2500, concurring therefore also for the short-term increase and decrease in the 2C2100 framework (see Figure SI.3). Beyond 2500 there is an increasing gap between UVic and CC16 because not all long-term saturation and carbon cycle feedbacks can be accounted for in CC16. However, as mentioned above, this gap is considerably smaller for CC16 than for CC13. Given the close match of atmospheric carbon content it appears somewhat surprising that CC16 overestimates the short-term increase in global mean temperature, suggesting that (1) the climate module of CC16 requires further adjustments rather than the carbon cycle model and (2) the derived mitigation policies are probably too conservative, at least with respect to the short term. For all three mitigation frameworks, CCGL shows a stronger (short-term) increase in the atmospheric carbon content and consequently global mean temperature, than CC16 or the UVic ECSM. While for scenarios without CDR is was close or even below the trajectories obtained with CC13. Again, the reason is the rather fast exchange between carbon reservoirs in CCGL, implying that the amount of CDR obtained with CC16 is simply too small to compensate for the extra emissions resulting from the substitution effect. The increase in atmospheric carbon content and global mean temperature is only exceeded by BEAM which shows again a good match with the long-term dynamics, but appears to be too restrictive for the short-term dynamics, compared to UVic ESCM. Again, we observe for the UVic ESCM towards the end of the simulation horizon irregularities in the temperature response to which we turn next. 3.6. Sensitivity Analysis with Respect to Vertical Ocean Mixing Global mean temperature shows a significant increase in the UVic ESCM simulations around the year 3300 which is at a point in time when emissions (and CDR) have been zero already for almost 1000 years. The increase is explained by an ocean deep convection event, resulting in a temporary carbon flux from the ocean to the atmosphere with a total of about 8 GtC outgassing in a region of the Southern Ocean and in a substantial amount of heat loss from the ocean that adds to the warming triggered by the ongoing leakage of formerly injected carbon. This becomes also evident in the sensitivity experiments where we considered different parameterization of vertical mixing (Figure 6). A slower vertical ocean mixing (kv low) results in a slower air-sea gas exchange, postponing therefore the ocean deep convection event whereas faster vertical ocean mixing brings the event forward. These highly variable deep convection events appear in model runs with and without CDR and are influenced by several factors such as stratification strength and sea ice volume (Reintges et al., 2017).",395.2272

For the zero carbon emission simulations (lower panel in Figure 4) we observe that compliance with the 2∘C goal can be achieved in CC13, CCGL and almost in BEAM (peak temperature increase is 2.03∘C). Still, it needs to be kept in mind that we have left the DICE2016R assumptions with respect to exogenous land-use emissions and exogenous forcing unchanged. (Still, even with zero land-use emissions and linearly decreasing exogenous forcing from 0.5 W/m2 in the year 2015 to 0 W/m2 in the year 2100, application of CC16 result for zero emissions from 2015 onwards in a committed warming increase of 1.43∘C temperature relative to preindustrial after starting in 2015 with a temperature increase of 0.85∘C). Noteworthy is that UVic ECSM allows for compliance up until the year 3500 (with the DICE2016R assumptions of exogenous forcing and land-use emissions), confirming that CC16 can be considered too pessimistic with respect to its remaining emission budget. However, we observe for the UVic ECSM trajectory an irregularity in the temperature increase (which is also present as a small increase in the atmospheric carbon content via the temperature feedback) due to an ocean deep convection event. We discuss this issue in more detail below. 3.5.

The SCC measure the economic cost of an additional ton of carbon dioxide and are according to Nordhaus (2017) the “most important single economic concept in the economics of climate change (p. 1518).” Table SI.T5 displays the SCC (in 2010 USD) for the three mitigation frameworks and the three carbon cycles in the year 2015, 2020, 2025, 2030, and 2050 (to allow comparison with Nordhaus, 2017) for cumulative CDR in order of 0 (only abatement), 100, 500, 1000, and 1500 GtC. In line with the discussion of the remaining carbon emission budgets (Section 3.1), the SSC decrease when moving from CC16 to CC13 to CCGL. With CDR being used as long-term strategy to reduce the atmospheric carbon concentration in the CBA framework, the influence of CDR on the near-term SCC is almost negligible (up to the year 2030) and has a small decreasing effect in 2050 for amounts of CDR which result in an emission reduction substitution effect. In contrast, in both the 2C and 2C2100 framework, the availability of CDR results in significant reductions in the SCC. For example, in CC13 the SCC are 142 USD in year 2015 if as only option emission reductions are available to limit temperature increase to 2∘C. With CDR available at an operational cost which results in a cumulative amount of 1500 GtC CDR, the SCC drop to 44 USD. 3.3. Oceanic Carbon Storage under the (False) Assumption of Perfect Storage The faster exchange between reservoirs in CCGL also results in a stronger difference in the amount of CDR deployed between oceanic CDR and oceanic CDR under the (false) conjecture of perfect storage. Figure 3 shows the time profile of the difference between these two CDR options for all three carbon cycles in the 2C framework. We have chosen a CDR cost scenario that corresponds to a cumulative amount of 1500 GtC CDR until the year 2500. For a smaller cumulative amount of CDR (i.e., steeper marginal CDR cost) the difference shrinks. As shown already in Figure 1, there is a significant difference between perfect storage and oceanic storage for CCGL. Because of the rather fast exchange, the substitution effect is smaller with oceanic CDR (and only present for very flat CDR cost that allow carrying out the extra CDR to compensate for the carbon cycle feedbacks) than with perfect storage. Accordingly, a social planner who falsely assumes perfect storage would set emission reductions too low (and in turn emissions are too high) such that more CDR is needed to compensate for carbon returning to atmosphere. In sum, the false assumption with respect to CDR results in an extra cumulative amount of CDR of about 180 GtC in comparison to the optimal amount of 1500 GtC under the correct assumption. With CC13 there is almost no difference due to the effect that there is almost no difference between perfect and oceanic CDR in that model (cf. Figure 1). With CC16 we observe a small difference, resulting from the same mechanism as for CCGL but the cumulative extra amount of CDR is below 10 GtC (in comparison to the optimal amount of 1500 GtC). 3.4. Implementation of Climate Policies without Ocean CDR in BEAM and UVic ESCM We turn now to the question how well the atmospheric carbon and global mean temperatures trajectories obtained from optimal mitigation policies are reflected by corresponding simulations obtained in more sophisticated carbon cycle and Earth system models. We focus here on the optimal mitigation policies derived with CC16 and implemented the obtained carbon emission and CDR paths in CC13, CCGL, BEAM, and UVic ESCM. The optimal polices were implemented until the year 2500, followed by zero emissions and zero CDR until the end of the simulation horizon in the year 4000. We look first at mitigation policies without CDR before we turn to selected CDR policies. Figure 4 shows the development of atmospheric carbon content and the increase in global mean temperature for business-as-usual emissions (as obtained in DICE2016R without climate policy), for carbon emissions in the CBA framework obtained with CC16, and for zero carbon emissions throughout the entire simulation period. The latter simulation serves the purpose to illustrate the degree of committed warming and the influence of the exogenously determined non-CO2 forcing across the different carbon cycles.",394.36551

First, due to the very slow exchange between carbon reservoirs in CC13 all emissions end up in the deep ocean in the year 4000 for CDR application that cumulatively exceeds 1000 GtC in the CBA framework. Furthermore, we even observe that extra carbon, in excess of the cumulative emissions is removed from the atmosphere to the deep ocean, implying that atmospheric carbon content is lower than in the reference scenario without any emissions from the year 2015 to the year 4000. However, for 2C and 2C2100 we do not observe this effect for CC13 because here the substitution effect with respect to abatement results in a too strong emission increase. Still, the atmospheric carbon content in the year 4000 is significantly lower with CC13 than with CC16 or even CCGL. Accordingly, peak and average temperature do not increase beyond 2500 in CC13. Second, due to the fast exchange between carbon reservoirs in CCGL the substitution effect with respect to abatement is very low in the CBA framework, at least within the displayed scale of CDR (up 1500 GtC). Here, a significant increase in emissions can only be observed for cumulative CDR larger than 2500 GtC. In the 2C and 2C2100 frameworks the substitution effect is present, however, resulting in a less step increase in cumulative emissions for increasing cumulative CDR compared to CC13 and in particular CC16.",395.22714

In line with Anderson and Peters (2016) and Obersteiner et al. (2018) CDR is already deployed before 2050. Furthermore, we observe a significant emission substitution effect. As discussed above, CC16 is most restrictive in terms of the (remaining) emission budget. Without CDR the 2∘C target cannot be achieved under the DICE2016R specification of non-CO2 forcing, however, already a cumulative amount of 100 GtC CDR is sufficient (here the solid purple line indicating peak temperature drops to 2∘C) for compliance with 2∘C. Increasing amounts of CDR result in increasing amounts of cumulative emissions, in turn with consequences for the temperature response beyond 2500.

However, for larger CDR amounts, resulting in increasing cumulative emissions, we observe that peak and average temperature increase with the cumulative amount of CDR, indicating that carbon previously removed returns to the atmosphere (as indicated by the increasing blue atmospheric bar), causing peak and average temperature to rise again.",394.09909

In the CBA framework the bulk of CDR is carried out beyond 2100 and CDR is used as long-term strategy to reduce the atmospheric carbon concentration (a). This becomes evident by looking at the corresponding distribution of emissions in the carbon cycle (c) as a function of cumulative CDR. First, there is almost no substitution effect with respect to emissions until cumulative CDR reaches 1200 GtC. Second, there is only a modest decline in peak temperature (purple line) compared to the situation without CDR. The reason is that the DICE model (also in the 2016R specification) has a rather modest estimate for climate impacts, suggesting that in a framework where the cost of abatement are weighted against the avoided damages of climate change a peak temperature increase of about 4∘C is optimal. CDR is postponed into the future when the economy is very rich (due to continuous growth in the DICE economic model), making CDR cheaply affordable. This is indicated by the stronger decline in average temperature (orange line). While without CDR the decline in temperature is limited by the rather slow natural carbon uptake, with CDR this option is used to speed up this process.",394.31903

While both, CC13 and CCGL, still allow for positive cumulative net emissions for compliance with the 2∘C goal, CC16 requires already negative cumulative net emissions for this goal. The remaining carbon emission budgets for the period from 2015 until 2100 to comply with the 2∘C goal are 195 and 392 GtC for CC13 and CCGL, respectively. Assuming instead that non-CO2 forcing follows RCP2.6 (i.e., increasing to 0.4 W/m2 until 2100 and constant thereafter; van Vuuren et al., 2007), the remaining carbon emission budgets are calculated to increase to 161, 511, and 868 GtC for CC16, CC13, and CCGL, respectively. For comparison, the IPCC (2014) AR5 carbon emission budgets (adjusted with information from the global carbon budget (Le Quéré et al., 2016) to correspond to the time period from 2015 until 2100) are 230, 312, and 366 GtC for 66%, 50%, and 33% fraction of simulations meeting the 2∘C goal. Accordingly, one could argue that CC16 carbon budget comes closest to the IPCC estimates (given non-CO2 forcing corresponds to RCP2.6), however, resulting in a temperature increase below 2∘C in the majority of the models considered by the IPCC. 3.2. Time Profile, Emission Reduction Substitution, and Long-Term Impacts of CDR For all three carbon cycle models, the optimal amounts of CDR and net emission are higher in the CBA frameworks than in the 2C framework (Figure 1). This can be explained by the different time profile of CDR utilization and in turn different substitution effect. Figure 2 shows, in the left panel, similar information as Figure 1, but including the time profile of cumulative oceanic CDR (until 2500). The right panel shows the cumulative carbon emission as function of the cumulative amount of CDR, displaying in addition information on how the cumulative carbon emissions (the added carbon) are distributed among the different carbon reservoirs in the year 4000. Furthermore, the right panel contains information about peak and average temperature for the period 2015 until 2500 and for the period 2500 until 4000. Both panels provide the information for the CBA and 2C mitigation framework in CC16 from the top to the bottom, respectively. The information for the 2C2100 framework is provided by Figure SI.F2a.

For all three carbon cycles we observe a kink towards the right end side of the plots, for CC16 close to 1, for CC13 around 0.8, and for CCGL (even though less pronounced) around 0.4. These kinks are explained because (1) we impose the constraint that atmospheric carbon concentration cannot be reduced below its preindustrial level and (2) we leave the other assumptions of DICE2016R with respect to exogenous forcing and land-use emissions unchanged. Due to increasing non-CO2 exogenous forcing (up to 1 W/m2 until the year 2100 and constant at this value thereafter) there is some non-CO2 induced warming, causing damages. Accordingly, it would be optimal for a flat marginal CDR cost curve to decrease atmospheric carbon concentration below its preindustrial level to achieve negative CO2 forcing (compared to the preindustrial level) to compensate for the non-CO2 forcing. Accordingly, without that constraint we would observe more cumulative CDR to the left of this kink. The second kink which is only present for CC13 and CCGL (in CC16 the transition is smooth) coincides with a substitution effect becoming present: here the amount of emissions actually increases in response to the availability of CDR.

However, this holds only true until a certain value for the operational cost, as measured by the slope of the marginal cost curve: if the marginal cost function becomes too steep, it becomes too costly to carry out the extra CDR and in case of fast exchange between the boxes (CCGL carbon cycle model) less oceanic CDR is carried out compared to perfect storage.",394.07255

The CCGL box model assumes that atmospheric carbon is a constant fraction of the carbon stock in the upper box. Consequently, excess carbon in the deep ocean enters directly the atmosphere, while in the specification with CC13 and CC16 it needs to pass through the upper ocean box.

Injections were simulated to be carried out at a 2900 m depth to minimize leakage and maximize retention time. At this depth, liquid CO2 is denser than seawater, which has the additional advantage that any undissolved droplets would sink rather than rise to the surface (e.g., IPCC, 2005). The simulated injection were based on the OCMIP carbon sequestration protocols and carried out in an idealized manner by adding CO2 directly to the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) pool (Orr et al., 2001). Thus, we neglected any gravitational effects and assumed that the injected CO2 instantaneously dissolved into seawater and was transported quickly away from the injection point and distributed homogenously over the entire model grid box with lateral dimensions of a few hundred kilometers and many tens ofmeters in the vertical direction (Reith et al., 2016). We also conducted sensitivity experiments for our CDR simulations that focus on the parameterization of vertical ocean mixing. Vertical ocean mixing plays a key role in (1) determining ocean circulation, (2) bio-geochemical cycles, and (3) ocean to atmosphere heat and carbon fluxes. We varied this parameterization by increasing and decreasing it by 50% (hereafter, denoted by Kv_low and Kv_high), which is within the range of observational estimates (Duteil & Oschlies, 2011).

For parameter c2 we considered a broad parameter range (to reflect the uncertainty about the scale of CDR), ranging from 0.01833 × 1012 USD/GtC2 to 18.33 × 1012 USD/GtC2, corresponding to a marginal CDR cost at the first GtC of 90 USD/tCO2 and 10,080 USD/tCO2, respectively. The marginal CDR cost curve is linear in the amount of CDR, and increasing with a slope c2. In order to study the effect of CDR cost we vary this parameter c2, that is, the slope of the marginal CDR cost curve, in our analysis. An extra social cost of CDR arises in case of nonperfect storage from carbon cycle feedbacks and is determined by the carbon cycle models. Consequently, CDR allows saving the atmospheric social cost (i.e., the carbon price), but causes at the same time an oceanic social cost (arising from the carbon cycle feedbacks). Accordingly, for equal operational cost, the optimal amounts of CDR (and subsequently the optimal amount of emission via the substitution effect) differ for the three different carbon cycle models. Note that this approach is different to Chen and Tavoni (2013) who explicitly corrected the effectiveness of the CDR methods (i.e., increasing effectively its units costs.) The DICE model with the different carbon cycles for the different mitigation frameworks has been solved with the constrained optimization package Knitro in AMPL. All model files are included in the supplementary information S2. 2.2. Assessment of Optimal Climate Policies with Respect to Carbon Cycle Feedbacks For the assessment of the appropriateness of linear box models for the investigation of CDR in IAMs, we implemented the derived optimal policies in (1) the nonlinear BEAM model (Glotter et al., 2014) and the intermediate complexity UVic ESCM (Eby et al., 2013; Weaver et al., 2001). For this exercise, we followed Glotter et al. (2014) by extending the simulation time-horizon beyond the optimization time-horizon until the year 4000. Until the year 2500 we imposed the optimal climate policies derived by the IAM and beyond 2500 we assumed that both emissions and CDR were zero. This allowed us to investigate how well the linear box models simulate potential outgassing events and corresponding temperature responses of long-term CDR policies. Note that with a time-horizon beyond the year 2500 in the optimization exercise, the optimal policies would have suggested to sustain positive CDR in case of outgassing. We compare the distribution of carbon in the carbon cycle for the various mitigation scenarios in the year 4000 against a reference scenario (with zero emissions from 2015 onwards). In both models, BEAM and UVic ESCM, we imposed the same assumptions about the development of non-CO2 exogenous forcing as in DICE2016R.",395.2149

The differences arise from different assumptions regarding the implementation (e.g., scale and technology applied) and from the uncertainty about cost components. Furthermore, the studies neglect potential cost-savings via technological progress and economies of scale, but also neglect potential cost increases via (general equilibrium) price effects if the methods are applied on a larger-scale. We believe that the operational cost are best described by a convex cost function capturing increasing marginal costs, which holds (1) within a specific CDR method and (2) across CDR methods: because specific CDR methods are most likely applied to the most suitable locations first (e.g., close to an appropriate alkaline mineral deposit in case of alkalinity management) while increasing the amount of CDR requires more effort (e.g., larger transport distances to new mineral deposits and larger transport distance on sea) and because generic (oceanic) CDR implies that a set of CDR methods are considered which can be ordered according to their unit cost (like the McKinsey abatement cost curve; McKinsey&Company 2010). While almost certainly small-scale CDR (in the ton or even small megaton scale) can be carried out rather cheaply, the major uncertainty surrounds the operational cost of large-scale CDR application (in the gigaton scale). Accordingly, we assumed a simple linear-quadratic cost function for CDR operation:",394.06668

With the first option, carbon was actually removed from the carbon cycle. Such an option would correspond to geological storage under the unrealistic assumptions that there are no scarcity issues and no leakage. The first option was primarily used as benchmark for the second option to investigate how carbon cycle feedbacks in the simple carbon cycle models change the optimal CDR application. With the second option, carbon was removed from the atmosphere and added to the deep ocean. Here, we considered rather generic oceanic CDR and accordingly, such an option would correspond to a set of CDR methods that aim at sequestering carbon in the deep ocean. Probably the best analogy is achieved by considering deep ocean carbon injection (IPCC, 2005; Marchetti, 1977), however, also other CDR methods with significant deep ocean carbon sequestration are relevant. With the third option, carbon was removed from the atmosphere under the assumption of perfect storage; however, it is actually added to the deep ocean. Accordingly, the decision-maker observes in the next period that his expectations about carbon stocks and storage were wrong. Thus, after each time step a new optimal policy is derived, however with the actual values for the carbon stocks in the different boxes resulting from oceanic CDR. Consequently, here the mitigation policy was iteratively derived under constant updating with respect to the true values for the carbon stocks and corresponding forcing and temperature change. The optimization structure and objective function of DICE remained unchanged during the iterative optimization. Note that without different specification of CDR, the optimization from the first period until the planning horizon and the iterative optimization coincide. The third option provides insights regarding unforeseen leakage from submarine geological storage (here with the extreme assumption offull leakage into the deep ocean) under the condition that changes in carbon stocks are properly monitored. The third option also provides insights to which extend an inaccurate carbon cycle model results in less efficient climate policies under the condition of perfect monitoring.",395.21248

We neglected the possibility to consider another overshooting framework where compliance with the 1.5∘C goal would be achieved from 2100 onwards, as investigating such a tight climate target is only sensible with additional mitigation options for non-CO2 emissions and land-use change emissions (Rogelj et al., 2016; Su et al., 2017).

For example, PAGE, MERGE (model for estimating the regional and global effects of greenhouse gas reduction), FUND, and REMIND (regional model of investments and development) rely on impulse-response representations of the (oceanic) carbon cycle (van Vuuren et al., 2011). This type of carbon cycle model does not allow tracking of the removed carbon, which is placed into the ocean, and in turn cannot account for outgassing of this carbon from the ocean. While impulse-response representations can capture very well nonlinarites in atmospheric carbon development, box-type representations become indispensable if options like (oceanic) CDR are considered when accounting for carbon cycle feedbacks (Rickels & Lontzek, 2012). In this article, we thus focus on the box-type carbon cycle models that are used in IAMs. The article is structured as follows. Section 2 presents our methodical approach, explaining first the derivation of optimal mitigation policies (including CDR) in DICE and explaining secondly the comparison of the results obtained with linear carbon cycle models to nonlinear carbon cycle and Earth system models. Section 3 presents and discusses our results, Section 4 discusses potential limitations of our study, and Section 5 concludes. 2.1. Derivation of Optimal Climate Policies Including CDR We derived optimal climate policies with the widely used IAM DICE in its most recent version (i.e., DICE2016R) (Nordhaus, 2017). We consider as optimization time horizon the DICE2016R planning period, starting in year 2015 and running until year 2500. We used three different carbon cycles models in combination with the economic and climate module from DICE2016R: (1) the carbon cycle model from DICE2016R itself (labeled CC16 in the following), (2) the carbon cycle model from DICE2013R (Nordhaus & Sztorc, 2013) (labeled CC13), and (3) the carbon cycle model from Gerlagh and Liski (2017) (labeled CCGL). All three carbon cycles models are box models with linearized carbon fluxes between the boxes. Our research objective restricts the carbon cycle models we consider to those that allow the tracking of carbon removed from the atmosphere and added to nonatmospheric carbon reservoirs like the ocean. The box models we have chosen have this property. In both, CC16 and CC13, the three boxes represent atmosphere, upper ocean, and lower ocean. CCGL is instead based on the assumption that atmosphere and upper ocean instantaneously equilibrate, implying that the atmospheric carbon stock is a constant fraction of the carbon stock in the first box, whereas the second and third box represent the terrestrial biosphere and deep ocean carbon stocks, respectively. CC16 and CC13 differ only in their calibration. While CC13 is primarily calibrated to capture short-term dynamics of the global carbon cycle (until the first 100 years), CC16 is calibrated to capture rather long-term dynamics (up to 4000 years) (Nordhaus, 2017). DICE2016R operates in 5 year time steps and the carbon cycle models are calibrated accordingly. In CCGL changing the time steps does not only imply an adjustment of the transition matrix between the boxes, but also the share of emissions (and CDR) entering the different boxes. While for 1 year time steps all emissions enter the upper box (atmosphere and upper ocean), for time steps larger than 1 year, a certain fraction enters directly the other two boxes. For all three carbon cycle model specifications we used the climate model (forcing and temperature specifications) from DICE2016R, its assumptions about the development of exogenous non-CO2 forcing (resulting from other GHG emissions and aerosol emissions), its specification of economic dynamics, and its objective function (i.e., a social welfare function, which is the discounted sum of the population-weighted utility of per capita consumption). More details and the parametrization of the three carbon cycle models are presented in Supplementary information S1.",395.51304

In response, the carbon cycle model in DICE2016R is calibrated to include improved long-run dynamics (up to 4000 years) (Nordhaus, 2017). Yet, DICE2016R has not yet been part of a comprehensive assessment with respect to the appropriateness of its carbon cycle model. Furthermore, the suitability of carbon cycle models applied in IAMs to capture carbon cycle feedbacks with respect to CDR has not yet been systematically assessed.",394.03196

Warren et al. (2010) find that the selected IAMs show a significant variation in climate outcomes whereby some even result in inconsistent estimates for carbon concentrations and temperature response, compared to Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) simulations. They suggest for example that the FUND (climate framework for uncertainty, negotiation, and distribution) model underestimates the temperature response and results therefore, in less ambitious mitigation strategies than are optimal. However, van Vuuren et al. (2011) find that the outcomes of the IAMs are within the range of more complex models. Still, they conclude that differences between carbon and climate outcomes across IAMs are significant and matter with respect to the derived policy advice. Hof et al. (2012) also find significant differences, but conclude that the implications on optimal policies are small, relative to other factors, and argue that for example a rather strong carbon cycle feedback found in the PAGE (policy analysis of the greenhouse effect) model (in its 2002 version) has only modest impacts on near-term mitigation due to discounting. In conclusion, the differences between carbon cycle models in IAMs matter in particular when considering exogenously given climate targets like the 2∘C goal instead of endogenously derived optimal climate outcomes.",394.05015

IAMs and dynamic global vegetation models have been used to analyze implications of terrestrial CDR for land use, water consumption, and food production (e.g., Boysen et al., 2017, 2017; Smith et al., 2015). The influence of carbon cycle feedbacks on the efficiency of CDR has received less attention. One exception is the study of Chen and Tavoni (2013) who investigate CDR by direct air capture (DAC) as an additional mitigation option in the IAM WITCH (World Induced Technological Change Hybrid). Based on their standard DAC deployment scenario (without oceanic outgassing) they use information from Vichi et al. (2013) to estimate the average reduction in effective atmospheric carbon removal and correct the effectiveness of DAC for this outgassing. With this general correction, they find that instead of extra removal to compensate for this outgassing about 30% less DAC is deployed compared to their standard specification.

Removing carbon from the atmosphere results in reduced uptake of or even release of carbon from the terrestrial biosphere and the ocean for modest or strong removal scenarios, respectively. Enhancing oceanic carbon uptake (by, e.g., ocean alkalinity management) implies that not only atmospheric but also terrestrial carbon is added to the ocean and vice versa in case of terrestrial carbon uptake enhancement (by, e.g., afforestation; Keller et al., 2014).

Life-cycle costs with technology assumptions favorable to methanol. Note that, in this graph, hydrogen and methanol are derived from biomass. We have not included any scarcity costs caused by biomass availability restrictions, nor are carbon taxes included in the cost of gasoline. 7Our model is globally aggregated, and the cost of transporting biomass long distances is not included. It is less expensive, however, to transport liquid rather than solid biomass. We have therefore made runs in which the potential use of biomass in the heat sector is limited exogenously to 100 EJ/yr. 8It is rather common that representatives from the auto-industry think that hydrogen is the most viable long-term option. John Williams, the head of GM Corporation’s team on global climate issues: ‘‘I think I am on pretty solid ground in saying that the long-term vision is hydrogen. But there is a lot of work between here and there’’ (New York Times, October 31, 1999). Similarly, Herman Kuipers, Shell Global Solutions, states that spending money on methanol is like betting on the wrong horse—hydrogen is the winner (presentation at the seminar ‘‘The Hydrogen Society—Reality or Fiction’’, Stockholm 22/9 1999). 9It may in this context be noted that the Bush administration recently stated that it would supplant the 8-year-old PNGV (a partnership for a new generation of vehicles) with a new program (Freedom CAR) to encourage the development of hydrogen and fuel cells (Financial Times, January 2002). 10Some have interpreted our Fig. 7 as an argument against such niche markets and early learning programs, but even if there would be 1,000,000 hydrogen-powered cars on the roads by 2020, that would be too small to show up on the graph. A more detailed discussion on policies to bring about the hydrogen-based transportation sector is discussed in Ogden et al. (2001).",239.1472

The status ofthe global biogeochemical flows PB is approached via the intended nitrogen fixation (chemical N fixation in fertilizers and anthropogenically induced biological N fixation by legumes)43. As regional constraints we derive grid-cell-specific thresholds for nitrogen fixation considering the control variables used to assess the global PB for nitrogen flows : atmospheric NH3 concentrations and N concentrations in surface runoff (see Supplementary Table S2 for the proposed critical limits ). As proposed by de Vries et al.  we calculate critical global losses ofa given N compound to either air or water by with the risk indicator RI= [N]crit/[N]present and [N]present being the present concentration ofthe respective control variable. In contrast to de Vries et al.  we do not limit RI to values smaller than or equal to 1, as this would strictly forbid additional or initial fertilization in areas that are not close to the regional thresholds, thus forbidding fertilization on all primary and unfertilized land. Based on the respective range ofcritical limits, we obtain a range ofglobal RI of1.79–5.36 for atmospheric NH3 concentrations and 0.61–1.53 for N in surface runoffusing global average values ofNH3−present =0.56μgm− and Nrunoff−present=1.63mgNl−. Assuming that the ratio between N fixation and polluting compounds does not change , we multiply the respective RI by the agricultural nitrogen fixation of 121.5 Tg N in the year 200044. To derive grid-cell-specific thresholds for nitrogen fixation limiting NH3 concentrations we divide the global critical value by the global land area. The grid cell threshold for limiting N runoff to surface waters is calculated by dividing the global critical value by surface runoff in the agricultural baseline scenario. Under the regional optimization constraintsCN, biomass plantations can be allocated until the combined nitrogen fixation and fertilization ofthe agriculture baseline scenario and biomass plantations reaches one ofthe regional thresholds. Therefore, we derive nitrogen fertilizer requirements for biomass plantations from biomass harvest under the assumption that extracted nitrogen (0.15% N in dry matter for herbaceous biomass  and 0.5% N in dry matter for woody biomass ) is replenished with an efficiency of50%46.

These SSPs depict three different global futures with substantially different socio-economic conditions that aim to reflect different socio-economic challenges to mitigation and are ofgreatest interest to assess BECCS potentials. SSP1 describes a sustainable future in which environmental boundaries are respected, including climate change mitigation (RCP2.6 in the baseline) and hence bioenergy needs. SSP2 represents a world that follows a middle-of-the-road pathway with intermediate challenges for mitigation, whereas SSP5 describes a resource intensive world with high GHG emissions (RCP8.5 in the baseline), high challenges mitigation and hence bioenergy needs. Land-use patterns are designed to ensure demand-fulfilling food production, where demand is externally prescribed based on extrapolation ofhistorical relationships between population and GDP on national levels . Land-based mitigation for MAgPIE is driven by carbon prices and bioenergy demand from the REMIND model as implemented in the SSP exercise  and affects agricultural land for food and feed production.

In BECCS systems, the harvested biomass can be converted to different types ofsecondary energy carriers via multiple technology pathways that allow for carbon capture and subsequent carbon storage, for example, in underground reservoirs. We consider two biomass conversion technologies: biomass conversion to hydrogen (B2H2) and biomass conversion to liquid fuels (B2L), which form the upper (B2H2) and lower (B2L) end ofbioenergy conversion and carbon capture efficiencies . B2H2 has potentially very high capture rates (up to 90%) because hydrogen is a carbon-free secondary energy carrier. In contrast B2L has a low capture rate (up to 48%) since the resulting fuel contains a significant share ofcarbon. Fossil fuel input to biomass production and transportation is assumed to be constant at 10% ofthe primary energy content . The annual NE potential (PNE) is calculated via: with cr: capture rate, Hcum: biomass harvest, ELUC: land-use-change emissions and EP: production and transportation emissions.

Their parameterizations are based on observations ofthe growth and harvest characteristics ofMiscanthus/switchgrass cultivars for the herbaceous biomass plantations, and willows/poplars and Eucalyptus plantations for temperate and tropical woody biomass plantations, respectively. Herbaceous biomass plantations are simulated to be harvested on a multi-annual basis, and woody biomass plantations every eight years with a plantation rotation time of40 years. LPJmL was applied to determine the potential changes in carbon pools and fluxes under conversion to biomass plantations, potential irrigation water requirements ofbiomass plantations and water availability for irrigation, as well as biogeochemical and hydrological impacts ofthe agricultural baseline scenarios. All simulations were preceded by a 5000-year spin-up with natural vegetation, bringing soil carbon pools and vegetation distribution into equilibrium. A subsequent second spin-up period of390 years introduces historical agriculture with annual cropland extent and crop type distribution per 0.5° grid cell and irrigated fraction per crop type after ref. 35 from 1700–2005, allowing for a historical adjustment ofcarbon pools. During the spin-ups, the climate (historical climate data from CRU TS3.1036 ofthe years 1901–1930) was repeated. Further simulations from 2005–2050 serve as spin-ups for the actual simulations using the different baseline agricultural land-use patterns without biomass plantations and a temperature-stratified climate scenario with a global warming of2K during the 30-year-mean around 2100, reproducing the median response of19 general circulation models .

That is, both of these models take the efficiency price of carbon as an input datum.

For each of these scenarios, the models then reported the year-by-year net absorption of carbon through afforestation sinks. In turn, the two models were each coupled to MERGE by taking a convex combination of the six time-phased scenarios - and also allowing for the possibility of a delay in initiating them. At this point, our calculations lead us to believe that afforestation sinks will not have a major impact upon the optimal price and quantity of carbon abatement. There are differences between the results from GCOMAP and GTM, but the optimal afforestation sinks are small in relation to the total quantity of carbon that would need to be abated in order to meet a radiative forcing target.",324.6524

See Table 1 for a description of some of the key characteristics of these gases. MERGE is based on a simple decay model for each of the non-C02 gases, From these decay rates, one can see that methane abatement could play a strategic role if there is a need for an immediate reduction in radiative forcing. The short-lived F-gases could play a similar role but their volume is quite small. With nitrous oxide and the long-lived F-gases, there is no possibility of a quick turnabout. Even with extensive near-term abatement, their concentrations would decay slowly. With the exception of N20, we took the 2000-201U baseline emission trajectories from EMF 21 (ref. 3) and extrapolated them linearly from 2010 through 2100. Thereafter, it was assumed that there would be no change. With N20, we assumed that emissions remained constant at their 2000 level. For each gas, we expressed estimates of abatement costs as a percentage of the baseline for that year. We then supposed that there would be technical progress in abatement over time. Specifically, we assumed that within each cost category, there would be 1.5 times the 2010 percentage of abatement in 2050 and twice the 2010 percentage in 2100, etc.",325.89332

For this purpose, we have used what we believe to be a middle-of-road projection of the global population 396 / The Energy Journal - assuming that it will rise from 6 billion people in 2000 to 10 billion in 2100, and that it will stabilize thereafter. Virtually all of this growth will take place in the developing countries. Separate projections are provided for each of nine regions. There are four high-income regions. These constituted the OECD in 1990: 1) USA, 2) Western Europe, 3) Japan, and 4) Canada and Australia-New Zealand. There are also five low-income regions: 1) Eastern Europe and former Soviet Union, 2) China, 3) India, 4) Mexico and OPEC nations, and 5) ROW (rest of world). The model employs ten-year time steps extending from 2000 through 2150. Population projections may be debatable, but there are even more controversies with respect to productivity and per capita GDP growth. Through 2020, we have taken over these projections from the ""reference case"" defined by the Energy Information Administration.8 Thereafter, we have extrapolated by using logistic functions. The initial point is the EIA projection for 2020. Each of our logistic functions converges to the identical asymptote. The ""limit to growth"" is $200 thousand per capita, but this limit is not reached for several centuries. This value is astronomical in comparison with today's GDP in India, China, and other low-income nations. It was chosen so that there would not be an immediate decline in the growth rate of the high-income regions. For each of the nine regions, the third point along the logistic curve is an arbitrary individual estimate of the per capita GDP in the year 2100. These values were chosen so as to allow for a smooth transition post-2020 - and a partial convergence of the low-income countries to those with high incomes by 2100. For example, the U.S. grows from $36 thousand in 2000 to $115 thousand by 2100. India grows rapidly (from $0.5 to $25 thousand), but is still far behind the U.S. by the end of the century. All dollar values here are expressed in dollars of 2000 purchasing power, and are shown at market exchange rates. If, instead, we had employed ""purchasing power parity"", there would have been much higher initial GDP values for the low income nations, but lower growth rates of GDP and of emissions. With PPP, we have found only minor changes for the high-income nations.",327.19764

A computer listing is available at that website. the emissions and decay of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N20), these gases were not included in abatement strategies. Moreover, due to a paucity of data, the earlier treatment of carbon sinks can be characterized as rudimentary, at best. In more recent versions, the model has been modified to include a more sophisticated treatment of the roles of non-C02 GHGs and terrestrial carbon sinks. Each region s domestic economy is viewed as though it were a Kamsey Solow model of long-term economic growth.6 The time paths of investment and consumption are strongly influenced by the choice of a ""utility"" discount rate. In the following calculations, we have based this rate upon a market-oriented ""descriptive"" viewpoint.7 Energy-related emissions in MERUE are projected through a bottom up perspective. Fuel demands are estimated through ""process analysis"" and a top-down production function of the inputs of capital, labor, and electric and non-electric energy. Conservation is both price-induced and non-price-induced. Specific allowances are made for technical progress and for learn-by-doing. Each period's emissions are translated into global concentrations and, in turn, to the impacts on mean global indicators such as radiative forcing and temperature change. The MERGE model may be operated in a ""benefit-cost"" mode - choosing a time path of emissions that maximizes the discounted utility of consumption, after making allowance for the disutility associated with climate change. It may also be operated in a ""cost-effective"" mode - supposing that international negotiations lead to a time path of emissions that satisfies a constraint on concentrations, on radiative forcing, or on temperature change. Individual geopolitical regions are distinguished in the MbKUh model. Abatement choices are distinguished by ""where"" (in which region?), ""when"" (in which time period?), and for some cases ""what"" (what greenhouse gas to abate?). As a result, all of our estimates must be viewed as lower bounds on the actual future costs. Since no quota rights are specified for each region, we do not report the regional costs of emissions control. We only provide the global control costs - expressed in terms of consumption losses. These losses are independent of the burden sharing arrangement.",325.645725

The focus of efforts to reduce the threat of global climate change has shifted over time. Initially, the goal was to stabilize or reduce C02 emissions. With the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the focus shifted to stabilizing atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations.4 Although this represents a step forward, it may not go far enough. There are many uncertainties in the causal chain connecting human activities to impacts. These relate to emissions, the carbon cycle, radiative forcing, climate change, and market and non-market impacts. In Energy Modeling Forum study 21 (ref. 3), the target was extended beyond atmospheric concentrations to radiative forcing. When conducting a multi-gas analysis, there are distinct advantages in moving from concentrations to radiative forcing. With the former, it is customary to use Global Warming Potentials (GWPs) for making tradeoffs among greenhouse gases. A number of studies have shown the arbitrariness of this approach and have argued that tradeoffs should be based on the contribution of each gas to achieving a particular target.5 Focusing on radiative forcing bypasses the need to rely on GWPs and provides for tradeoffs among gases based on their relative value. We begin with a description of how the MERGE model has been modified to include multiple greenhouse gases and sinks. We then examine the implications of constraints on radiative forcing under a ""C02 only"" control scenario and a ""multi-gas and sinks"" control scenario. Finally, we add a decadal constraint on temperature change. We find that mitigation costs are substantially higher when the focus is on the rate of change rather than on absolute change. The timing of costs is also significantly changed. Two caveats are in order. First, we assume complete ""when"" and ""where"" flexibility. That is, emission reductions are made both when and where it is most economical to do so. To the extent that these two principles of economic efficiency are violated, mitigation costs may be substantially higher. Second, in this paper, we provide only one component of the cost/benefit calculus. Our focus is exclusively on mitigation costs. No attempt is made to calculate the value of the damage reductions achieved with the adoption of a particular policy initiative. Clearly, such information is essential for informed policy making. However, the necessary analysis is well beyond the scope of the present effort.",327.16604

Even at ambient concentrations, CO2 is absorbed efficiently by solutions with high pH (Johnston et al., 2003). The most common industrial method of absorbing a gas into solution is to drip the solution through a tower filled with packing material while blowing the gas up through the tower (a “packed tower” design). Indeed, if we choose a capture efficiency of 50%, which is suitable for our application,  the combined gas and liquid pumping energy requirements of running such a unit are rather small – 1.2 GJ/tC, as shown in Table B.3. This is an empirical result based on towers which were designed for high capture efficiency; a tower with this dense packing need only be 1.5 m tall to achieve 50% capture efficiency. Furthermore, the low flow rate of CO2 (because it is so dilute in air) requires the “tower” to be very wide – perhaps hundreds of meters in diameter. A contactor of these dimensions would be very different from conventional packed towers and might look like a trickle-bed filter used in wastewater treatment plants: a wide cylindrical basin, drafted from underneath, with a rotating distributor arm. The properties of this type of design are likely dictated by “edge effects” – the nature of the system at the top and bottom of the bed – and by the engineering of the distribution mechanism for air and water.

At large scales (100’s of km), CO2 transport in the atmospheric boundary layer limits the air capture flux to roughly 400 tC/ha-yr (Elliott et al., 2001).",358.6827

If emitting sources, such as natural gas power plants, were displaced, the additional emissions could be significantly smaller. However, also note that we do not include additional non-CO2 GHG emissions or the upstream emissions associated with the mining, transport, and distribution of coal. 21 Even if CCS retrofits could be adopted quickly, several factors would restrict the eligibility of many plants for retrofitting, including additional space requirements for retrofit equipment and proximity to suitable CO2 storage sites [27]. 22 There are three conventional coal technologies and 11 regions so, even in the conservative scenario, if all regions were to maximize their implementation of retrofits, almost 400 GW could be installed globally in the 2031–2040 period alone.

However, the phenomenon of increased electrification is slowed in the LowEI scenario since there is less pressure to reduce carbon intensity and, thus, move to cleaner energy, given the smaller total energy demand. Thus, the total electricity demand is smaller in LowEI-57.8 than RefEI-57.8. 15 Note that a change in technology lifetime impacts the vintage structure in not only future time periods, but also historic time periods since MESSAGE tracks capacity installments pre-1985. Although the total installed capacity in the historic time periods is relatively fixed for each technology based on the load factor and the calibrated electricity generation, the new installed capacity depends on the vintage structure of the pre-existing capacity, which changes with lifetime. Thus, the new installed capacity in historic time periods is different in each of the lifetime extension scenarios, which leads to different vintage structures into the future. Essentially, the extension scenarios examine the implications of MESSAGE assuming a 40 or 50-year standard lifetime for conventional coal plants instead of30 years. 16 Throughout this paper, the cost of stranded capacity is equated with the stranded capital investment. We do not consider the opportunity cost associated with the additional revenue that could be earned by keeping a plant operating. This is not an issue when the financing period matches the plant lifetime (e.g., 30-year scenario), but there would be an opportunity cost in the 40 and 50-year scenarios where the financing period is less than the potential operating lifetime.",466.276832

In S8, the level of utility decreases by only 0.005% compared to the same scenario without revenue effect (S2) where it decreases by 0.05%. We find the same results for the carbon tax. The revenue effect in both scenarios (S6 and S8) prevents consumption for falling. Giving revenue to consumers as lump-sum transfers leads to a revenue effect but does not have an impact on the other variables. Graph E in Appendix B shows that the impact on output in the long term is the same as in S1 and S2. The increase just after the shock (2100) in (S1) and (S2) is due to an increase in public expenditure, which is affected to the output (Appendix B, Graph E). We show below that it is even less costly to recycle tax revenues to subsidize BECCS. – Recycling revenue to BECCS subsidy In S5, using tax revenue to finance BECCS subsidy leads to a very high subsidy rate (258$/tCO2). In order to meet the environmental target, the tax rate does not have to be as high as in (S1). Therefore, tax has a lower depressive impact on the economy than in (S1). With a carbon tax of 12$/t CO2 demand for fossil fuel slightly declines ( 7.8%). Recall that in (S1), the carbon tax rate is 22$/t CO2 and fossil fuel demand decreases by 13%. Also, the BECCS subsidy encourages the use of biomass which rises by 2.7%. As a consequence output and consumption are maintained at near their initial levels. The cost of the carbon tax with revenue recycled to subsidize BECCS is less than the costs of the other taxes studied. In S7, a fossil fuel tax of 22% yields a large revenue that can be used to subsidize BECCS up to 293$/t CO2. This, in turn, accelerates the deployment of BECCS. 73% of biomass emissions are captured in the long run. As CCS is not deployed for fossil fuel, the energy producer relies more on inputs substitution and BECCS to reduce its emissions. Surprisingly, it is less costly to achieve a given environmental target under S7 than under S8 or even S6. This demonstrates the role played by BECCS in reducing the cost of achieving emissions reductions. This second simulation shows that the issue of how tax revenues are recycled is as important as the choice to tax emissions or fossil fuels. If government decides to conduct an environmental tax approach (fossil fuel or carbon taxes), we show that it is less costly to recycle fossil fuel and carbon tax revenues to support BECCS, than to return it to consumers as lump sum transfers. We show too that the most-efficient instrument, according to the criteria of CCS and BECCS adoption and economic welfare efficiency, is S5 (see Appendix B, Graph B). – Recycling revenue from the two-part instrument (S4) We propose to study a variant of scenario (S4). In S4 we study the impact of a two-part instrument that can be a combination of a carbon tax and a BECCS subsidy, or a tradable system that allows for negative emissions. The carbon tax yields revenue part of which is used to finance the BECCS subsidy (same rate).",239.1336

The price of fossil fuel drops by 1.8% which leads to a rise in fossil fuel demand of almost 4%. Also, the biomass price slightly declines, but not enough to boost demand. The environmental target is reached only thanks to the abatement technology since the subsidy provides the wrong incentives in terms of the level of energy production. Environmental taxes involve net transfers from polluter to government, while subsidies lead to net transfers in the opposite direction. In our model, government spending is allocated to the final output. Considering the soft emissions reduction target the impact of transfers on YC is marginal.

Therefore, neither products nor values can appear from nowhere, the Walrasian general equilibrium is satisfied. 4.1.1. Energy consumption and emissions The start year is 2005 as we have complete date. In 2005, atmospheric carbon emissions were 808.9 Gt of C which correspond to 2993 Gt of CO2 (Nordhaus, 2008). According to IEA (2008b), world fossil fuel consumption in 2005 was 420.558 EJ. We assume that all the carbon included in one unit of energy is released in the atmosphere. World fossil fuel consumption and the linked emissions are presented in the following table (Table 1). By dividing the CO2 emissions 28,485 million metric tons, by world consumption of fossil fuel of 420,588 million GJ, we obtain the CO2 emission intensity of fossil fuel. We write eF¼0.068 for the CO2 content of the fossil resource. We conclude that 1 GJ of energy delivered from fossil fuel leads on average to 0.068 t of CO2. In this model, we consider only fossil fuel consumption in the secondary energy sector. CO2 emissions are released during the process of converting primary energies into secondary energies. Therefore, we analyze the electricity and heat sectors as well as the fossil fuel transformation sector (petroleum refineries). According, to IEA (2008), fossil fuel consumption in those sectors in 2005 was 155 EJ, which represents about 10.5 Gt of CO2. The other 17.9 Gt of CO2 are considered exogenous emissions from final use sectors such as industry, transport, services, agriculture and non-energy uses. According to IEA (2008) world biomass consumption in 2006 was 49.64880 EJ. The predominant use of biomass currently is for fuel for non-commercial applications, and inefficient stoves for domestic heating and cooking in developing countries. Biomass",251.07108

In this case, taxing either the carbon emissions or the fossil resource are almost equivalent. It is also an interesting option when monitoring emissions directly is difficult (Goulder and Parry, 2008). Therefore it would seem a good proxy for the amount of pollution to be regulated.

The implications of a fossil fuel tax are straightforward: it will provide an incentive to substitute the fossil fuel resource for a clean resource, but it will give no incentive to start using CCS. Therefore, we need a tax on emissions (a carbon tax).",251.08352

The majority of these studies uses dynamic optimization models and shows that the availability of CCS reduces the cost of decreasing emissions. However, with optimization models, those studies suggest equivalence between the social optimum and the decentralized equilibrium which limit the realism of the models (Beaumais and Schubert, 1996). We choose, therefore, to study the equilibrium in a decentralized economy because this allows us to examine how the economy reacts to environmental policy tools via pricing. der Zwan, 2006, Otto and Reilly, 2008). Gerlagh and van der Zwan (2006) compare policy instruments (fossil fuel tax, carbon tax, renewable subsidy and a carbon intensity portfolio) in relation to the adoption of CCS using their DEMETER model. They show that a carbon intensity portfolio (recycling the carbon tax to subsidize renewable energies) is the most cost-efficient instrument to reduce the costs of addressing climate change. With a CGE model with endogenous technological change, Otto and Reilly (2008) compare the economic efficiency of several instruments (a cap and trade system, a subsidy on CCS adoption and a R&D subsidy) to meet an environmental target. The authors show that a combination of a cap and trade system and a subsidy on CCS adoption or a R&D subsidy is always more cost effective in achieving the abatement target than a cap and trade system alone.

In order to identify strategies to mitigate climate change, we need to consider combining several technologies in different sectors. CO2 capture and storage technologies (CCS) have received increased attention due to their large estimated potential to reduce CO2 emissions (MIT, 2007; IEA, 2008; IPCC, 2005). The process consists of separation of CO2 from industrial sources and transporting it to permanent storage in secure locations such as deep saline aquifers and depleted oil and gas fields (for a CCS technical review, see IPCC, 2005). Bioenergy with CCS (BECCS) is an emerging technology that is beginning to attract attention. Environmental and economic studies focus on its application in the electricity and heating sectors (Carpentieri et al., 2005; Rhodes, 2007; Uddin and Barreto, 2007) and the biofuel sector (Kheshgi and Prince, 2005; Lindfeldt and Westermark, 2008, 2009; Laude et al., 2011; Mathews, 2008; Möllersten et al., 2003). Considering that CO2 from biomass combustion or transformation is neutral as long as biomass is grown sustainably, BECCS can contribute to a net removal of atmospheric CO2. Indeed, biomass absorbs CO2 from the atmosphere through the process of photosynthesis and releases it during combustion. If the released CO2 is captured and stored permanently in geological storage sites then we would have a situation of ‘‘negative CO2 emissions’’. According to Obersteiner et al. (2001), this option offers the dual benefit of providing low-carbon energy products and removing carbon from the natural carbon cycle. Moreover, BECCS could have an important role in the future energy mix. It has the potential to reduce the mitigation costs of achieving low atmospheric CO2 concentration targets (Azar et al., 2006, 2010; Katofsky et al., 2010; Luckow et al., 2010; van den Broek et al., 2011; van Vuuren et al., 2007). A major issue related to the deployment of BECCS is its economic viability. To become significant, economic incentives will be needed. It seems important to mention that, since CO2 from biomass transformation is considered neutral, traditional environmental policy instruments, such as environmental taxes, are not appropriate for this technology. Also, in the Kyoto framework, CO2 emissions are accounted for in different ways, depending on their origin (e.g., biomass vs. fossil fuel). The regulation providing guidance for GHG accounting does not consider BECCS as eligible for the first commitment period of the protocol (2008–2012) (Grönkvist et al., 2006). Thus, there are currently no incentives for firms to capture CO2 from biomass. In our view, there should be a reward for every ton of carbon avoided by means of CCS – whatever its origin (biomass or fossil); we discuss policies that support BECCS directly. To avoid catastrophic climate change and keep temperature increases to levels of a maximum of 2 1C, CCS for both biomass and fossil fuel will need to be part of the mitigation portfolio. It remains therefore to determine the policy instruments that could be used to provide adequate incentives for CCS and BECCS. We need also to determine what would be the cost of achieving emissions reductions using these instruments. The literature on BECCS focuses mainly on cost evaluations and environmental potential and tends to neglect the issue of different ways of promoting it.",251.651027

Assuming that these technologies would not be available to the system would significantly impact the GHG prices. As shown in Figure 8, the long-term GHG price without BECS increases in 2100 by a factor of 6 in the CO2-only and a factor of 2 in the multigas scenario. This result not only illustrates the vital role that biomass-based negative emissions might play in the long term, but perhaps more importantly highlights the importance of technological change (Grübler, 1998), its path dependency (Roehrl and Riahi, 2000), and the necessity of research and development in new emissions control technologies.",466.96833

In the very long term, the bulk of the emissions reductions in the multigas scenario also stem from CO2 and the disparity in prices between the scenarios become less significant. We find three main reasons for this trend. First, the high inertia of the energy system due its long-lived infrastructure (lifetimes > 30 years) make deep reductions in CO2 (for example, premature phase-out of power plants) comparatively costly in the short term. Secondly as mentioned earlier there are a large number of cheap (below 10$/TCE)16 non-CO2 mitigation options available in the short-term, making them more attractive than relatively costly CO2 reductions. The third effect comprises the comparatively limited long term mitigation potential of the non-CO2 sources as compared to CO2. Only one third of the baseline’s total emissions in 2100 come from non-CO2 sources. Consequently, as the emissions constraint becomes more stringent over time, deeper cutbacks of CO2 become necessary in the multigas scenario, driving the overall price of mitigation closer to the one in the CO2-only case.",467.13357

Also the N2O concentrations in the multigas case are just reduced by 5 percent in the long run (by 2100), which is partly due to the long residence times, but also due to earlier mentioned conservative assumptions concerning the potential of N2O mitigation for those sources where large uncertainties exist (such as agricultural soil).",461.86353

Clearly, the most pronounced changes in CH4 concentrations are achieved in the multigas scenario due to direct mitigation aimed at the reduction of mainly non-energy CH4 emissions. The combined effect of various low-cost mitigation options and the relatively short atmospheric lifetime of CH4 (about 12 years) results in sizable reductions of concentrations already in the first few decades.

In the presence ofITC, electricity prices are lower and demand is higher than were there no ITC. In short, the empirically observed ITC in this sector works somewhat against the goals of policy.

First, as is well documented (Jorgenson et al., 2000, 2008, 2009), the parameter governing the allocation of full consumption between the demand for goods and services (i.e., consumption) and the demand for leisure is a dominant factor in CGE model outcomes, and not just IGEM's. Household choices concerning leisure demand simultaneously determine labor supply and, hence, labor income. For a given national income, decisions on how much to consume determine the household and business saving that funds private investment. Investment adds to the capital stock which, in turn, is the source of capital income. From these, it is evident that this single decision influences the entire supply side of the economy. With IGEM as estimated, the compensated elasticity of labor supply in the 216 GtCO2-e simulation averages around 1.0 for the period 2007–2050. As shown in Fig. 11, altering IGEM's parameters and approximately halving this number approximately halves the welfare losses. Accordingly, this single trade-off has clear and important implications for reconciling simulation results across methodologies. alternatives, the 216 GtCO2-e scenario is simulated with auction revenues recycled, first, through reductions in the average marginal tax rate on labor income and, second, through changes in a general, economy-wide investment tax credit. The welfare changes for these simulations also appear in Fig. 11. In terms of consumption, each of these mechanisms is welfare improving as each nearly halves the welfare losses arising with lump-sum transfers. The investment tax credit is favored only slightly over reductions in the marginal labor tax rate. In terms of full consumption, there emerges a rather different conclusion. In the long-run, the investment tax credit further improves welfare with greater capital accumulation substituting for labor and allowing more leisure to compensate the loss in consumption. Conversely, the marginal labor tax rate is inferior to both mechanisms when considering full consumption. True, there is an improvement in terms of goods and services but the labor tax promotes labor supply (and demand) at the expense of leisure and, so, the welfare losses in full consumption are greater.",251.097904

As a result, the welfare losses are about 75% ofthose for the 203 GtCO2-e case.

For the more restrictive caps (203 and 167 GtCO2-e), the welfare losses in terms of full consumption are only 18 to 34% of those exclusive of leisure. Second, allowing the use of domestic offsets is welfare improving. When measured in terms of consumption, the welfare losses are 36 to 39% smaller with unlimited offsets. This loss improvement increases to 55% when measured by full consumption and, in the 287 GtCO2-e scenario, the welfare gain is 31% larger with unlimited offsets. Third, the percentage point loss in welfare per giga-tonne abated increases with the severity of the cap but is smaller for full consumption than for consumption and is smaller with unlimited domestic offsets than with no domestic offsets.

In broad terms, the losses in revenue are comparably borne by employees and “shareholders.” The components of value added appear to share the consequences of mitigation policy more or less equally. However, a closer examination reveals that the reductions in capital incomes are generally somewhat larger than those for labor. This is certainly consistent with the policy's adverse impacts on investment and capital accumulation and suggests that shareholders fair marginally worse than do employees under these cap and trade regimes. specifically these concerns as labor is measured in terms of qualityadjusted hours rather than persons and prices adjust to equate the labor (hours) demanded by employers with the labor (hours) supplied by households. Still, inferences can be drawn from the observed changes in labor. Fig. 10 shows the changes in capital and labor quantities that correspond to the income changes in Fig. 9. Fig. 10 also shows the changes in the labor intensity of output as measured by industry input–output ratios. The real changes in primary inputs in Fig. 10 match the nominal changes shown in Fig. 9. More importantly, the economy becomes more labor intensive. Households substitute leisure for labor and consumption for saving. Businesses substitute labor for energy, now more expensive, and capital, now less available.

The increased price of consumption relative to the price of leisure prompts households to substitute the latter for the former.

These adjustments along with those discussed in section 5 are qualitatively identical to what happens in all other years and scenarios with the observed changes being merely matters of degree. Our choice of the 203 GtCO2-e scenario also is motivated by the fact that it is closest in spirit and magnitude to the numerous public policy initiatives to which IGEM recently has been applied (EPA, 2009). Given this proximity to legislative proposals, the ensuing discussions of the details of this scenario are more likely to be of interest and relevance to those crafting these proposals. As shown in Fig. 6, the emissions constraint and resulting allowance prices adversely affect each aspect of aggregate demand (real GDP) — consumption, investment, government purchases, exports and imports. Perhaps surprising are the disproportionate losses borne by each ofthese components. Consumption, which is 60% offinal demand, accounts for only 27% of the $0.35 trillion loss while investment and exports, at 20% and 12% ofGDP respectively, account for 40% and 28% of the year's loss. To the extent the cap is binding, everything becomes more expensive and everyone then must adjust to the higher prices. However, the reactions to these higher prices are far from uniform and are rather more complex and varied. The impacts on industry prices (and domestic production) are presented in Fig. 7. Clearly, energy prices — coal, oil, gas and electricity — are most affected, with coal more so than any other commodity. This is not surprising in that 87% of the year 2006 GHG emissions are related to the use of coal (30%), oil (41%) and gas (16%). In addition, coal is high in carbon content in relation to the other fossil fuels and is used extensively along with gas and some oil in the manufacture of electricity. Domestic crude oil and gas extraction prices decline as the lower domestic production that follows from reduced petroleum demand is obtained at lower cost. However, this is the only price (cost) reduction that occurs. All non-energy prices increase. Some — like those of agriculture, chemicals, stone, clay and glass, primary metals, electrical machinery (semiconductors) and services (waste management) — are affected both directly and indirectly as their activities are emissions generating. Others like construction, food, textiles, furniture, paper, publishing, motor vehicles, instruments, communications and trade are affected only indirectly. The overall impacts on the economy are dominated by the decisions of households. Their first decision concerns the inter-temporal allocation of expenditure on good, services and leisure.",251.0931

First and most obvious, allowance prices in all cases continue to rise as the emissions constraint becomes more stringent or, equivalently, as the gap widens between the cap and what emissions would have been in its absence. Second, economic agents choose the least expensive portfolio of abatement options subject to their individual availability and, here, domestic offsets are the low cost source. Given the MAC schedules for abatement opportunities from these sources and under the condition that buyers can acquire whatever abatement is economically justified from these markets, abatement overall is cheaper with domestic offsets than it is without them. The importance of these allowable external alternatives cannot be overemphasized. In their absence, long-run allowance prices are 66% (287 GtCO2-e) to 87% (167 GtCO2-e) higher. Limits on their use, statutory or otherwise, force more expensive alternatives. The sources of abatement are illustrated in Figs. 2 and 3 which detail the 203 GtCO2-e simulation results. Without domestic offsets, there is less banking, more expensive abatement from CO2 and non-CO2 sources and earlier and larger market penetrations ofthe more expensive bioelectricity and CCS (Fig. 2). However, with unlimited domestic offsets over this period, businesses choose the lowest cost options available to them. There is more banking, less expensive abatement from CO2 and non-CO2 sources and delayed commercialization of bioelectricity and CCS (Fig. 3) all because cheaper abatement is available. The consequences for the overall economy correspond to the patterns of allowance prices and abatement costs. Fig. 4 shows the effects on real GDP. Clearly, the economy can absorb these constraints on emissions with relative ease. The largest of these involves an almost imperceptible 18 basis point reduction in annual GDP growth. For comparison, IGEM benchmarks to the Energy Information Administration's (EIA's) Annual Energy Outlook (AEO) 2006 and to AEO 2008 (used here) differ by 33 basis points (EIA, 2006, 2008) or almost twice as much. Across all scenarios by 2025, economic losses range from 0.3 to 3.7% of the baseline GDP estimate. By 2050, this range expands to 0.7 to 7.3%. Not surprisingly, the losses in real GDP are, on average, almost 40% smaller under each of the three caps when the less expensive domestic offsets are allowed to compete. As discussed below, the impacts on GDP are spread across all its components with the effects on household spending being proportionally among the smaller. As shown in Fig. 5, the reductions in consumption are, ultimately, a third to a half of those of GDP. By 2025, the consumption losses range from 0.1% to 1.5% of the baseline estimate. By 2050, the range of losses grows to 0.2% to 3.6% and, again, the losses are about 40% smaller with unlimited domestic offsets. Obviously, progressively more stringent caps raise allowance prices (Fig.1) and increase their economic costs (Figs. 4 and 5). Equally obvious is that the cheaper abatement available in limited quantities from domestic offsets eases these burdens. From a policy design perspective, two points remain clear. First, under even the most restrictive cap, the economic losses are small with overall growth being only slightly slowed. Second, and most importantly, allowing any and all measurable, verifiable and permanent abatement sources to compete freely for their rightful place in the mitigation hierarchy is the principal way ofavoiding or minimizing these adverse market consequences.",251.73694

Our focus is estimating the economic costs of these regimes as there are no considerations ofthe effects ofclimate change, positive or negative, on the economy or the possible benefits ofthese regimes in terms ofavoided economic damages. IGEM is a dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model of the growth and structure of the U.S. economy and has been used in a variety of efforts related to climate change and climate change policy (e.g., see Jorgenson et al., 2000, 2004, 2008, 2009; EPA, 2009). Because IGEM represents a comprehensive range of economic responses in 35 commodity-industry groups and 5 final demand sectors and because it is econometrically estimated from over forty years of market data, it is well suited to address both the broad and detailed market implications ofclimate change policy over the intermediate term. The market-based incentives arising from cap and trade climate policy secure emissions abatement through three sources — output reductions, input and output restructuring and induced technical change. In this paper, we emphasize IGEM's structural content in exploring these three pathways. The remainder ofour paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents policy assumptions unique to this analysis. Sections 3, 4 and 5 provide, respectively, discussions of the temporal consequences of six cap and offset combinations, the details of macroeconomic adjustment common to all years and all model runs and the effects on domestic production and U.S. capital and labor markets.

However, current INDCs are projected to lead to global emissions around 55 GtCO2eq in 2030 (UNFCCC 2015c), inconsistent with cost-optimal scenarios that limit global warming to 2 °C (figure 1), and more so to 1.5 °C (Rogelj etal 2015, tables 1–2). The five year revision cycle ofthe Paris Agreement, which will begin by 2020, requires parties to regularly update their mitigation ambition in order to close the gap with least cost mitigation scenarios. At the national level, our results suggest that all G7 parties need to increase their mitigation efforts in order to contribute meaningfully to the global goals agreed in Elmau and Paris while respecting a range of visions of climate justice and the principle of CBDR + RC. Commitments from China, Russia, and Brazil are also clearly incompatible with the agreed 2 °C warming limit. Nevertheless, despite the inadequacy of the 2 °C warming limit as a safe ‘guardrail’ against climate change’s adverse effects (UNFCCC 2015b) and the deficiency of G7 parties’ commitments in relation to that goal, the G7 agreement should be seen as a major step forward. Achieving global decarbonization over the course of this century is essential to halting warming and is a necessary step to achieve the Paris Agreement’s ambition of achieving ‘a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of GHGs in the second half of the century, on the basis ofequity’. The global decarbonization decided in Elmau, and in particular the decarbonization of developed countries, is to occur well ahead of the net-zero GHG target ofthe Paris Agreement. Therefore the Elmau agreement, understood as full decarbonization of the world economy and transformation of the energy sector, could be the crystallizing focal point that galvanizes joint mitigation action towards the Paris Agreement’s goals and averts the most unfair solution ofall: unmitigated climate change.",212.326045

The latter approach is considered by many to be inconsistent with the principle of ‘common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities’ (CBDR + RC) enshrined in Article 3 ofthe UNFCCC treaty (UNFCCC 1992, Art. 3.1), but also seems inconsistent with some declarations and positions of G7 members themselves. The EU, for example, uses a capability-based approach to distribute mitigation efforts internally (Commission of the Europeans Communities 2008, p 9) and Japan supported considering ‘the impacts of GHG emissions of each Party on global warming’ (Japan 2014, p 2). Separately, non-G7 members supported different concepts of fairness that appear incompatible with current G7 commitments under a 2 °C warming limit: China, India and Brazil support concepts that emphasize historical responsibility for climate change (Winkler et al 2011) and the Least Developed Countries support a comprehensive approach similar to the GDR (Nepal on Behalf of the Least Developed Countries Group 2014, p 5). Here we presented approaches consistent with each of these visions of fairness and compatible with a 2 °C limit, provided that all parties adopt the same approach. The global emissions scenarios used in this study rely on cost-optimal and technical feasibility considerations within the IAM models used to produce them. Real world policy implementation will likely alter the global, and consequently national, emissions scenarios. Such real world global emissions scenarios can however not differ substantially from the IAM scenarios in the context of the physical imperative to rapidly reduce global emissions in order to stabilize global temperature. Further limiting global warming to 1.5 °C, as aspired to in the Paris Agreement, requires emissions of 27–31 GtCO2eq in 2030 and 13–17 GtCO2eq in 2050 (UNEP 2014). These ranges are in the lower end of the range of scenarios consistent with the Elmau agreement used in this study (27–42 GtCO2eq for 2030 and 14–19 GtCO2eq for 2050, figure 1). Future studies can apply the allocation framework developed here to determine, on the basis of equity, the further emissions reduction each party should undertake by 2030, to limit global warming to 1.5 °C. The global scenarios selected and presented in this study represent physically realistic emissions trajectories. However, all of the allocated national scenarios imply strong mitigation in all world regions except the Middle East and Africa. Applying such emissions scenarios domestically is not always politically acceptable given the economic and technological momentum of major emitting parties. The national emissions scenarios presented here should rather be seen as a basis for the allocations of emissions mitigation and financial or technological transfers, as encouraged in the Paris Agreement.",434.69421

Emissions allocations across the five approaches diverge rapidly for G7 parties, in particular after 2030 when the CPC and GDR approaches imply net negative emissions. Across the four ‘fair’ approaches (i.e. all but CER), aggregated emissions allocations over G7 parties are 44%–92% below 2010 levels in 2030, and 84%–144% below 2010 levels in 2050 (figure S3 in supplementary information). By contrast, the INDCs ofthe G7 parties are consistent only with the CER approach. Only the conditional long-term target of the EU28 matches the reduction ofother approaches: EPC and CAP. Achieving the G7’s objectives in a fair way implies the participation of all countries. Other countries can align with the G7 INDCs in one of two ways: either by picking the CER approach, or by picking the approach resulting in the least ambitious national mitigation targets. Assuming that G7 countries do not raise the ambition of their current commitments, only the first of these two options would guarantee a likely chance of limiting global warming to 2 °C (Meinshausen et al 2015). All UNFCCC parties would then follow the CER approach and reduce their emissions by the same amount compared to 2010, (6%–40% by 2030 depending on the global target, figure 2). However, such a universal mitigation target is considerably more stringent than other approaches for developing countries. To illustrate the second option, we use five approaches to derive allocations (figure 2 and table 1) for Brazil, Russia, India and China (BRIC), which together are responsible for a growing share of international emissions (37% in 2010, 39% incl. LULUCF (Gütschow 2015)). By picking the least stringent of the five approaches, China would emit −25% to +6% in 2030 compared to 2010 under the GDR approach, India +105% to +169% under the CPC, Russia −6% to −40% under the CER and Brazil −0% to −36% under the EPC. The INDCs of Russia and China (Climate Action Tracker 2015) are inconsistent with any allocation approach applied here. The INDC ofIndia is consistent with the CPC and the EPC approaches (Meinshausen 2015). The indicative 2030 target of Brazil’s INDC, 43% below 2005, appears more ambitious than any approach’s allocation ifapplied to non-LULUCF emissions. However, a target 43% below 2005 levels including LULUCF emissions lies far above any approach’s allocation. Overall, national results of the ‘fair’ approaches are consistent with the inter-quartile range of targets (Pan et al 2015) aggregated from multiple approaches applied to RCP2.6. However, compared to the Pan et al (2015) study , we obtain slightly stricter targets for Japan and Russia, and much stricter targets for China with up to 81% reduction between 2010 and 2030 under the CPC approach. To illustrate the implications of equitable implementations of the G7 agreement for the rest of the world, we derive aggregated 2030 targets for five world regions—OECD, Economies In Transition, Asia, Middle East and Africa, and Latin America—, and compare these with the analysis of the IPCCAR5 region’s needs for economic development, and potential exports of carbon credits to fund later decarbonization ofthe economy. (Edenhofer etal 2014, figure 6.28) (figure 3). IPCCAR5 results depend on whether or not the underlying global scenarios allow net negative emissions. Further-more, differences in the methods used to interpret equity concepts, as well as in the choice ofbaseline scenario and political parameters, have caused discrepancies between the IPCC’s analysis and our own (see SI). Compared to IPCCAR5 results, our capability based results are more stringent for developed countries and less stringent for developing countries (especially in the Middle East and Africa), while GDR based results appear less stringent for developed countries; this is due to our choice of methodology (Jacoby et al 2008) (see SI). According to our analysis, 2030 mitigation targets across all approaches (relative to 2010 levels) range from +9% to −45% for Asia and from +14% to −53% for Latin-America, comparable with IPCC results. Allocations for the Middle East and Africa region vary greatly across approaches with targets between +14% and +108% above 2010 levels under the EPC, GDR, or CPC approaches, and up to +275% under the capability approach. These four ‘fair’ approaches allow both significant increases of emissions in the Middle East and Africa in line with the",434.6914

LULUCF emissions (see methods). To do so, the scenarios were multiplied by a vector that is an interpolation between the 2010 reported emissions divided by the respective 2010 scenarios values, and 1 in 2040 (Meinshausen et al 2011). As the harmonization amended the initial 2010 levels, the harmonized global scenarios (including LULUCF and bunker emissions) do not all exactly meet a 60%–70% reduction in 2050 compared to observed 2010 levels (figure 1). After harmonization, the seven selected global scenarios show instead an emissions reduction of 59%–70% over the 2010–2050 period. We added RCP2.6 to the seven selected IPCCAR5 scenarios. We calculated emissions allocations for 2011 onwards, since historical emissions are available for all countries only until 2010 (see SI for detailed methods). For the EPC and CAP approaches, a 30 year convergence period allows for a linear transition between initial international emissions ratios and emissions ratios calculated by each approach. Under the CPC and GDR approaches, historical emissions are accounted from 1990, the date of the first IPCC report and second World Climate Conference. Historical emissions are discounted successively by 1.5% each year in the past (Winkler et al 2011), starting in 2010, to account for technological improvement. The GDR approach is set to give equal weight to its historical responsibility and its capability components. The mitigation burden ofa country is based on the number of its citizens earning more than $7500 (in purchase power parity). Population (KC and Lutz 2014) and GDP (Crespo Cuaresma 2015) scenarios projections follow the SSP2—IIASA implementation (https:// tntcat.iiasa.ac.at/SspDb/) that assumes medium population and economic growth, and medium socioeconomic challenges for both mitigation and adaptation. The reference case projections used in the GDR approach are downscaled from RCP8.5—assuming no further mitigation measures. When no absolute target can directly be derived from a country’s Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC), we show the range of targets as available from two separate online assessments (Climate Action Tracker 2015, Meinshausen 2015). The national allocations and INDC targets are applied here to ‘Kyoto-Annex A’ emissions, excluding LULUCF emissions, since proposed accounting rules differ widely across countries.",211.47528

This model contains a database with historical and projected data of: national GHG emissions, population and GDP purchase power parity. We used GHG emissions data from the PRIMAP database (Nabel et al 2011) that combines UNFCCC CRF inventories for Annex I (UNFCCC 2014) countries and EDGAR42 data for non-Annex I countries (European Commission 2009). Incomplete historical data-sets are extrapolated in the past using the growth rates of CDIAC data (Boden et al 2012) for CO2 and MATCH data (Höhne et al 2010) for other GHGs. Country level emissions projections are obtained from downscaled Regional RCP emissions using the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway Two (SSP2) socioeconomic data (O’Neill et al 2015) and the assumption of exponential convergence of emission intensities within a region. We combined Kyoto-GHG (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, perfluorocarbons, hydrofluorocarbons and sulphur hexafluoride) emissions following the ‘SAR GWP-100’ (Global Warming Potential for a 100 year time horizon) introduced in the Second Assessment Report of the IPCC and used under the UNFCCC. We selected from the 846 IAM GHG scenarios available in the IPCCAR5 database those consistent with the G7 Elmau agreement. Scenarios were selected based on their dynamic capacity to achieve emissions reductions of 60%–70% between 2010 and 2050 (including emissions from LULUCF) as well as to reach net zero CO2 emissions by the end of the 21st century (figure S1 in supplementary information). We then removed seven scenarios that showed emissions values almost equal (<2% difference) to others (figure S1 in supplementary information). We further removed two scenarios that featured steep mitigation before 2020, plateauing by 2030, as well as an annual LULUCF emissions sink that exceeds 15 GtCO2 y−1 before 2100. Finally, we excluded a scenario that did not offer a likely chance of limiting warming to 2 °C. The seven selected scenarios result from five models involved in three model inter-comparison exercises (table S1 in supplementary information): the LIMITS (Kriegler etal 2013), the EMF22 (Clarke et al 2009) and the EMF27 (Kriegler etal 2014b) studies. Following this selection, we excluded LULUCF emissions from the global emissions scenarios to be allocated. We also subtracted international shipping emissions (CO2, CH4 and N2O only) and aviation bunker emissions according to scenarios from the QUANTIFY project (Owen et al 2010), both following IPCC-SRESB1—a scenario that limits global warming to 1.8 °C compared to the 1980–1999 average (IPCC 2007). In the scenarios used, shipping emissions increase by 288% over the 2010–2100 period and aviation emissions are 101% higher in 2100 after peaking in 2062. More ambitious mitigation from the aviation and marine sectors would create more emissions space for other sectors and countries. A ‘fair’ contribution from these sectors has not yet been clearly established but would likely require mitigation beyond that assumed here (Anderson and Bows 2012, Cames et al 2015). While Article 4 ofthe Paris Agreement covers global emissions, its lack of specific reference to bunker emissions and the absence of current policies leaves no ground to assume strong mitigation in these sectors.",433.69002

As a group, the G7 produced over 31% of international greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in 2010–over 27% including Land-Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) emissions (Gütschow 2015). The G7’s domestic mitigation efforts can therefore have a significant impact on climate change. Moreover, in producing over 65% of current global Gross Domestic Product (GDP) (World Bank 2014), the G7 has considerable capacity to fund and lead the transition to a zero carbon global economy. The G8 (G7 plus Russia) first recognized the need for emissions mitigation (Kirton et al 2011) in 1979 and in 1992 strongly supported the creation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) (Kirton and Kokotsis 2015, p 107). Five months before the Copenhagen Accord in 2009, the G8 endorsed Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recommendations to limit global warming to 2 °C and supported a global emissions mitigation target of 50% below 1990 levels by 2050 (G8 2009, p 4). Following the Elmau agreement (G7 2015, p 12) in June 2015, the G7 now supports ‘the upper end of the latest IPCC recommendation of 40%–70% reductions by 2050 compared to 2010’ (G7 2015), intended to preserve a likely (>66%) chance ofattaining the UNFCCC objective to limit global warming to 2 °C (Edenhofer etal 2014, table 6.3). In Elmau, the G7 also emphasized the requirement of a ‘decarbonization of the global economy over the course of the century’ and committed to do their part to achieve a ‘transformation of the energy sector by 2050’. The objective of the G7 agreement was later strengthened, in Paris, where G7 members and all other UNFCCC parties agreed to ‘achieve a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks ofGHG emissions in the second half of the century’ (which basically means net zero GHG emissions sometime between 2050 and 2100) and to hold ‘the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C’. In this study, we interpret the Elmau agreement as a requirement to reduce global GHG emissions by 60%–70% between 2010 and 2050 and fully decarbonize by 2100 at the latest. We note that the term ‘decarbonization’ is ambiguous, as it can be defined as the process of lowering carbon intensity (Edenhofer et al 2014, sec Annex I, Glossary) rather than the end-point ofnet zero CO2 emissions as often interpreted by the public and some governments (Hendricks 2015). We identify the seven cost optimal Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) scenarios from the IPCCAR5 database (https://tntcat.iiasa.ac.at/AR5DB/) consistent with our interpretation of the Elmau agreement (figure 1 and SI). We add to this set RCP2.6, the only one of the four Representative Concentration Pathways employed by the IPCCAR5 that offers a likely chance of limiting global warming to 2 °C (van Vuuren et al 2011). While just outside our interpretation of the Elmau criteria, with GHG emissions 57% below 2010 in 2050, RCP2.6 lies within the range of our selected scenarios for most of the century. These eight selected economically optimal scenarios result from mitigation policies starting in 2010 and 2020 and show global GHG emissions between +1% and −28% in 2025 compared to 2010 levels, and between −11% and −43% in 2030 (or between −12% and −55% for CO2). These mitigation targets are slightly more ambitious than the targets recommended by UNEP, namely −4% in 2025 compared to 2010, −14% by 2030 and −55% by 2050 (UNEP 2014), and are in line with the Paris decision target of40 GtCO2eq for 2030 (figure 1). The eight selected scenarios reach net negative CO2 emissions between 2056 and 2080 and some reach net negative GHG emissions after 2080 (see SI). If near-term targets lie at the least ambitious end of the range presented here, achieving the climate objective would require long-term targets to lie at the most ambitious end ofthe range. The question of how mitigation effort, or equivalently emissions rights, should be distributed between countries invokes complex and competing value judgements (Rose et al 1998, Ringius et al 2002, Bode 2004, Höhne et al 2006, Baer et al 2008, Jacoby et al 2008, Nabel et al 2011, Winkler et al 2011, Höhne et al 2013, Edenhofer et al 2014, chapter 6, Raupach et al 2014, Winkler and Rajamani 2014, Meinshausen et al 2015). In 2009, the G8 supported a differentiated 2050 target for developed countries of at least 80% compared to 1990 or more recent years (G8 2009, p 4) (figure S3 in supplementary information). At Elmau, the G7 stated its determination to adopt an agreement with legal force ‘applicable to all parties that is ambitious, robust, inclusive and reflects evolving national circumstances’ (G7 2015, p 12) but it has not subsequently provided near-term global targets or national emissions allocations consistent with the 2 °C goal. In the absence of international consensus on an effort-sharing approach, scientists and government representatives have employed a range of equity principles when modeling international emissions distributions consistent with holding global warming below 2 °C (Rose et al 1998, Baer et al 2008, den Elzen et al 2008, Jacoby et al 2008, Nabel et al 2011, Winkler et al 2011, Höhne et al 2013, Tavoni et al 2014, Raupach et al 2014, Pan et al 2015, Peters et al 2015, Meinshausen et al 2015). The IPCCAR5 grouped the regional 2030 mitigation targets of over forty studies into five categories according to distributive justice concepts associated with ‘capability’, ‘equality’, ‘responsibility-capability-need’, ‘equal cumulative per capita (CPC)’ and ‘staged approaches’ (Höhne et al 2013, Edenhofer et al 2014, figure 6.28). While the global GHG emissions scenarios ofthese studies result in the stabilized concentration levels (425–485 ppm CO2eq) required to have a medium chance (50%–66%) of limiting warming to 2 °C, they do not generally follow trajectories that are—under certain conditions—deemed technologically feasible and economically optimal within IAM modeling worlds (Höhne et al 2013). Under the strict implementation of such a non-optimal allocation approach, countries would have to engage in inter-temporal trading of emission permits (borrowing or banking) in order to achieve realistic mitigation trajectories that minimize aggregate economic costs. Such inter-temporal trading relies on governments that are stable and accountable over time, and on an emission trading system that allows countries to use or sell their future or past emissions permits. Such an arrangement does not appear to be on the horizon in the new post-2020 regime. In this study, we allocate to countries, on the basis of equity approaches, emissions trajectories that add up to global IAM emissions scenarios at any point in time. In addition to domestic mitigation, countries can use new mechanisms to match their emissions allocation. The recent Paris Agreement and decision recognized the voluntary ‘use of internationally transferred mitigation outcomes towards nationally determined contributions’ and encouraged the implementation of ‘results-based payments [K] for the implementation of policy approaches’ (UNFCCC 2015a). While no comprehensive global emissions trading scheme is currently in place, countries can match the emissions allocations derived in this study through a combination of domestic mitigation and financial contributions. These financial contributions could be purchases of mitigation outcomes as part of a global emissions trading scheme or as contributions to global climate finance. An assumption on the pricing, in terms of a contribution to climate finance, of a certain emissions allocation is necessary to compare currents efforts with the allocations derived in this study. The conversion of financial contributions to emissions reductions is beyond the scope ofthis study. Our study derives national targets that are consistent with various interpretations of equity and with the aggregate global decarbonization trajectory laid out in the G7 agreement. We model the five IPCC allocation categories as follows (see SI for further details). The ‘capability’ (CAP) approach, from Jacoby et al (2008), allocates to each country a share of global emissions proportional to its population divided by its per capita GDP—or proportional to its GDP when global net emissions become negative. The ‘equal per capita’ (EPC) approach, reflecting the ‘equality’ IPCC category, allocates global emissions shares that are proportional to each country’s population. The ‘Greenhouse Development Rights’ (GDR) approach proposed by Baer et al (2008), reflects the ‘responsibility-capability-need’ IPCC category, and allocates emissions shares based on the historical and projected business-as-usual emissions, the population and the wealth distribution ofeach country. The ‘equal cumulative per capita’ (CPC) approach allocates each country with total cumulative emissions in proportion to its cumulative population over a chosen period. Finally, the ‘constant emissions ratio’ (CER) approach pre-serves the relative distribution of GHG emissions across countries from the start of the allocation onwards. This status-quo approach, also referred to as the ‘grandfathering’ approach (Rose et al 1998, Müller and Höhne 2013) or ‘inertia’ (Peters et al 2015), is included in the ‘equality’ category by the IPCC, but is often considered less equitable than other approaches found in the literature (Caney 2009, Peters et al 2015).",434.0067

The shares of non-emitting primary energy supply that occurs for sequential periods beginning in 2010 for the OPT and HST policy in the FullTech scenarios: Colored areas display the median of reporting models. Individual model shares by period are indicated by black lines showing variation across individual models. The largest increase in the share of non-emitting primary energy occurs between 2030 and 2050, though the transformation continues throughout the 21st century. 14 Note that none of the IAMs have taken into account the complete list of all potential silver bullets that are currently discussed. This is not only because the development of such technologies is highly uncertain—thus different models would have very different prospects—but also because the AMPERE study, as a scenario exercise, intends to examine the interaction between the availability of major technology options that are shared among the IAMs and near-term policy actions, not to explore the entire space of possible technology developments, which would in itself be an interesting avenue for future research. In this regard, the no-silver-bullet argument may be augmented with the assertion that even silver bullets were to emerge they are very hard to guarantee, so that portfolio approach would be needed anyway to hedge against the technological risks. 15 Our separation of the century-scale time frames—pre-2030, 2030–2050, and post-2050—originates both from the design of AMPERE WP2 study and from our findings about technology deployment. First, according to the protocol of AMPERE WP2 study, during the first stage up to 2030, global emissions follow a trajectory toward the fixed year-2030 target. As a result, the amount of cumulative emissions and the associated emission mitigation burden during the next stages will critically depend on the first stage emission pathway to 2030. This distinct set-up helps explicitly assess the implications that near-term policy actions have for the attainability of long-term climate goals and attendant technology upscaling requirement after 2030. Second, the separation before and after the year 2050 is from our observation that, for the HST policy regimes, nearly all of the catch-up deployment is made between 2030 and 2050 (see Figs. 3 and 5). Therefore, if we had an alternative separation ofthe time frames, we might have not been able to elicit robust findings related to technology deployment and emission pathways after delayed policy actions, which is the main focus of this study.",466.22714

Additionally, Panel B includes both fossil and industrial carbon emissions and land-use change emissions. 11 Though it must be noted that delay in the “Not-to-Exceed” scenario renders the scenario unattainable with MiniCAM assumptions regarding economic growth in Groups 2 and 3. 13 While pasture and grass land have relatively low above ground carbon, they store a tremendous stock of soil carbon. Converting this land to bioenergy production would result in the release of this carbon. 14 We could limit radiative forcing to 2.6 W/m2 without CCS or without advanced transportation technologies or without bioenergy. But, without any of the three options, low stabilization targets were not possible within the MiniCAM model. aEmissions mitigation is indicated by negative sign (−). bNote that emissions mitigation greater than 100% means that TOTAL emissions are net negative. These occurrences are shown in cells with gray backgrounds and white lettering. cNote that in some delayed accessions cases emissions drop precipitously. 16 In this context, not massive means substantially less than the other scenarios. For example, the “Immediate Accession” “Not-to-Exceed” scenario requires 500 new nuclear power plants by 2020, while the “Overshoot” scenario only requires 126 new plants. 17 Emissions are relatively constant from period to period after the initial decline in 2020. Emissions mitigation, relative to the reference scenario, however, increases over time. This increased mitigation requirement is significant in Groups 2 and 3 because of the degree of growth in emissions in the reference scenario.",251.5326

This benefit of BECCS is also, somewhat paradoxically, its main political risk. The possibility of achieving negative emissions in the future may be perceived as a carte blanche for delaying emission abatement efforts. We caution against such an interpretation for a number of reasons. First, because of the long atmospheric lifetime of carbon dioxide, the less we emit in the near term, the more ambitious targets can be reached in the future. Second, the potential rate of temperature decline (about 0.6 ◦C per century) is too slow to act as an ‘emergency brake’ on short timescales, if climate damage becomes unacceptable. Third, the extent to which BECCS can be made available in the future is uncertain, due to uncertainties in land availability as well as technological constraints. Fourth, there are ecological and climate risks associated with the higher temperatures during the transient phase [30, 31]. This makes overshoot targets contentious, although they may be necessary in order to reach low temperature levels. Finally, to reach global negative emissions, other zero-carbon technologies need to be developed, nurtured to maturity by learning-by-doing in the marketplace and deployed at a very large scale [32]. This transition takes decades or more. Thus, near term emission reductions relative to business-as-usual scenarios take place and are cost-effective in all our model runs with temperature targets. In fact, by the end of the century, most of the abatement originates from technologies other than BECCS.",245.09985

Producing large amounts of bioenergy may have significant impacts on global food prices, biodiversity, water availability, etc [28]. A back-of-envelope estimate of global land requirements suggests that 200 EJ yr−1 of bioenergy may require around 500 Mha of land, or one third of global crop land (see calculation in the supplementary material available at stacks.iop.org/ERL/8/034004/mmedia). Also, climate change itself may impact the potential for bioenergy supply potential, although it is uncertain in which direction, at least for the global warming levels we consider in this letter [17]. If BECCS is severely limited by low biomass availability, other negative emission technologies such as direct air capture of CO2 could conceivably play a role similar to that of BECCS in reducing atmospheric CO2 concentrations [29].",245.099865

Since future costs are discounted, postponing abatement leads to lower net present value costs. Additionally, by enabling net negative emissions from the global energy system, BECCS makes it possible to reach temperature targets that are otherwise not feasible. • If overshoot is not allowed, the economic benefit of BECCS is considerably smaller. The reason for this can be understood as follows. BECCS can drive down the net present value of global abatement costs in two qualitatively different ways: either by enabling emission reduction efforts to be postponed or by lowering the overall marginal abatement cost curve at any given moment. For ceiling targets, the potential for delaying emission reductions is relatively small. Nevertheless, our model results indicate that BECCS can become competitive in scenarios with ceiling targets, and it may supply a significant fraction of global primary energy in the future. • Emission pathways towards 2 and 1.5 ◦C targets are presented. Our model results indicate that emissions over the period 2020–50 are higher if BECCS is included in the technology portfolio, especially for temperature overshoot targets. This corroborates the results of Azar et al [4] and van Vuuren and Riahi [7] who find that near term emissions can be higher if BECCS is available when meeting concentration and radiative forcing targets. • The rate of temperature decline is estimated to about 0.06 ◦C/decade for a large-scale implementation of BECCS (assuming near zero CO2 emissions from the rest of the energy system, 200 EJ of biomass per year, and a climate sensitivity of 3 ◦C for a doubling of CO2 concentration). • For an overshoot target that must be met by the year 2100 instead of 2150 the value of BECCS becomes smaller. The reason for this is that for such a short period for overshoot, the target becomes more similar to a ceiling target. • Under ceiling targets the economic value of BECCS is high when climate sensitivity is high or if it is very costly (or impossible) to drive down the fossil CO2 emissions from the energy system to near zero levels.",245.16967

This also explains why there are essentially no net negative emissions in the ceiling case with BECCS, since sustained global net negative emissions would lead to a continuous decrease in temperature. Even though no net negative emissions appear, the cost-effective emission pathway is somewhat higher in the near term (2020–50) when BECCS is available and lower in the long term (2060–100), see also [46]. Hence, BECCS enables a delay in emission reductions but keeps cumulative emissions approximately the same. (However, as shown in section 3.2, availability of BECCS does not have any significant impact on abatement costs of meeting ceiling targets.) Additionally, despite the temperature ceiling, there is room for a century-long overshoot in concentration (above the long term equilibrium level) due to inertia in the climate system [10, 11]. The 1.5 ◦C ceiling targets are not feasible in our model primarily due to constraints on technology expansion rates.

Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) is a technical option that could potentially generate sustained negative CO2 emissions while simultaneously producing electricity, heat or liquid fuels such as ethanol. If a large-scale expansion of BECCS takes place while carbon emissions from the rest of the global energy system are nearly eliminated, net negative emissions on a global scale can be achieved. In this way, BECCS can contribute to reducing global mean surface temperature [2]. Previous studies using technology-oriented energy system models (including studies with a previous version of the model used here) have shown that stringent CO2 concentration targets or radiative forcing targets can be reached at lower cost if BECCS is available [3–6], and that some concentration targets are only within reach if BECCS is available. For a given radiative forcing level or concentration target in year 2100, CO2 emissions levels in 2020 and 2050 can be higher if BECCS is included in the technology portfolio [4, 7].

Such negative emissions can be materialized when well-performing bioenergy systems are combined with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). Here, we develop an integrated global energy system and climate model to evaluate the role of BECCS in reaching ambitious temperature targets. We present emission, concentration and temperature pathways towards 1.5 and 2 ◦C targets. Our model results demonstrate that BECCS makes it feasible to reach temperature targets that are otherwise out of reach, provided that a temporary overshoot of the target is accepted. Additionally, stringent temperature targets can be met at considerably lower cost if BECCS is available. However, the economic benefit of BECCS nearly vanishes if an overshoot of the temperature target is not allowed. Finally, the least-cost emission pathway over the next 50 years towards a 1.5 ◦C overshoot target with BECCS is almost identical to a pathway leading to a 2 ◦C ceiling target.",376.58627

We have chosen relatively simple model structures to provide a transparent analysis framework. This simplicity comes at the price of neglecting potentially important effects. For example, the numerical model aggregates all fossil fuels into a single resource and is thus ill-suited for analyzing the effects of potential changes in relative resource prices. Further examples of potential model refinements include representations of the likely increasing marginal costs of CO2 sequestration with the increasing fraction of anthropogenic CO2 emissions being sequestered, the consideration of model and parametric uncertainty (and learning about these uncertainties), and the consideration of more refined damage functions. The adopted damage function neglects, for example, adaptation to a warmer climate (in which case returning to pre-industrial levels may not be optimal), and rate dependent damages. We hypothesize that implementing damage functions that incorporate simple descriptions of the effects of adaptation and climate change rates (e.g., Lempert et al. 2000) would likely result in less stringent reductions of optimal CO2 concentrations in the case of CO2 sequestration from air (Fig. 3). We explore some effects of parametric uncertainty by a simple scenario analysis. (Note that this approach still assumes perfect knowledge within each scenario). The high sensitivity of the optimal trajectories (Fig. 7) with respect to the representation of socio-economic inertia suggests that developing a more refined representation of this effect (cf. Schwoon and Tol 2006) may be a promising avenue for model refinements. It is important to stress that our models are nothing more than thinking tools for analyzing the coupled natural-human system in an extremely simplified, but transparent and consistent way.

In the next few decades this economic efficiency is above 100% due to the positive externalities due to the learning-by-doing and the alleviation offuture inertia constraints. Early sequestration efforts are quite valuable in this example. In the near term, the marginal sequestration costs are above the marginal abatement costs resulting in an economic efficiency of CO2 sequestration above 100%. The marginal costs for CO2 sequestration and abatement decline due to learning-by-doing. Because CO2 sequestration is a less mature technology than CO2 abatement, the marginal CO2 sequestration costs decay faster than the marginal CO2 abatement costs. In the long run, the marginal costs for optimal CO2 sequestration fall below the marginal costs for optimal CO2 abatement because CO2 sequestration is inefficient (due to leakage) and hence has a lower shadow value than CO2 abatement (similar to Fig. 2). The effect of the fossil fuel resource constraint is to increase the marginal CO2 abatement costs along an optimal trajectory (Fig. 6a,b). This increase in marginal abatement costs is due to the increase in optimal CO2 abatement that is required to keep the total fossil fuel use below the resource constraint. This increase in marginal CO2 abatement costs causes a decrease in the CO2 sequestration efficiency (Fig. 6c). The optimal strategies are sensitive to structural and parametric assumptions. This is illustrated by the optimal trajectories for CO2 concentrations and marginal CO2 abatement costs for different values of (1) the progress ratio of sequestration, (2) the cumulative capacity of CO2 sequestration in 2005, and (3) the socio-economic inertia constraint for CO2 sequestration (Fig. 7). This sensitivity analysis suggests that the considered optimal trajectories are relatively insensitive before 2050 with respect to the considered parameter ranges. Beyond the model year 2050, however, the optimal trajectories diverge considerably. The optimal trajectories are most sensitive with respect to the parameter representing socio-economic inertia (Fig. 7e,f). Higher feasible expansion rates allow a higher deployment of CO2 sequestration and result in lower optimal CO2 concentrations and marginal CO2 abatement costs. The trajectories of the optimal CO2 concentration are basically identical for all considered progress ratios (Fig. 7a). Changing the progress ratio does affect the trajectories of the marginal CO2 abatement costs (Fig. 7b). Cases with a faster reduction in the marginal CO2 sequestration cost (i.e., lower progress ratios) show lower marginal CO2 abatement costs. The availability of CO2 sequestration decreases the optimal CO2 trajectories (Fig. 7a) compared to the case without CO2 sequestration (Fig. 3c) for all considered progress ratios.",345.8697

CO2 sequestration has relatively small effects on the optimal atmospheric CO2 concentrations within this century when CO2 sequestration technology is relatively expensive and the reservoir half-life times are short. For example, the atmospheric CO2 concentrations rise to approximately 600 ppm by 2100 in the case of marginal sequestration costs of 1000 U.S.$ per ton C and a half-life time of 30 years (Fig. 3a). Increasing reservoir half-life times and decreasing sequestration costs result in decreasing optimal CO2 concentrations within the 21st century. For example, for a CO2 sequestration cost of 250 U.S.$ per ton C and a reservoir half-life time of 250 years, the optimal CO2 trajectory peaks at approximately 500 ppm (Fig. 3b). The secondary increase in CO2 concentration in the long run for the reservoir half-life times of 30 and 250 years (Fig. 3a,b) is due to the relatively early leakage of sequestered CO2. For a millennium reservoir half-life time, the optimal CO2 concentration does not show this secondary increase in the considered time horizon (Fig. 3c). For CO2 sequestration from point sources (Fig. 3a–c), the optimal CO2 trajectories stay above 400 ppm in the considered time horizon, even though the CO2 emissions to the atmosphere are substantially reduced to less than 2 Gt C /a (Fig. 2a). This persistence of the anthropogenic CO2 perturbation in the atmosphere is due, in the model, to the long atmospheric residence time of CO2, the CO2 leakage fluxes, and the constraint that the CO2 sequestration flux cannot exceed the CO2 production flux. In contrast, for CO2 sequestration from air without leakage (Fig. 3d) the optimal CO2 trajectories return to the pre-industrial level within the considered time horizon. The key differences between the simulations with sequestration from point sources (Figs. 3a–c) and sequestration from air (Fig. 3d) are the ability to enhance the CO2 sequestration flux beyond the CO2 production flux and the absence of leakage. The reduction of the optimal CO2 concentrations to pre-industrial levels in the case of sequestration from air is driven by the adopted damage function. Such an intentional “dialing in” of atmospheric CO2 concentrations arguably constitutes geo-engineering (Keith 2000), which opens up many questions that our current analysis framework does not address. (We return to this point in the section on caveats and research needs). The optimal CO2 paths, for arguably realistic assumptions about present CO2 sequestration costs, can be considerably lower than in previous optimal growth analyses (e.g., Tol 1997; and Nordhaus 2007). Reducing the atmospheric CO2 concentrations (Fig. 3) reduces global mean surface temperature changes (Fig. 4). For the BAU case (without any reductions in CO2 emissions) the global mean temperature increases by roughly 4°C by 2150. The optimal use of CO2 abatement alone reduces the temperature in 2150 to approximately 3.5°C. The optimal use of CO2 abatement and a CO2 sequestration option (either from point sources or from air) at initial marginal costs at or below 500 U.S.$ /tC and a half life times of 1000 years or more reduces this temperature change to less than 2°C in 2150 (Fig. 4). The optimal temperature trajectories for sequestration from point sources and from air differ considerably. The optimal temperature trajectory for all considered cases of CO2 sequestration from point sources stay above 1.5°C in the considered time horizon. In contrast, the optimal temperature trajectories for the considered cases of CO2 sequestration from air fall below 1.5°C. The availability of a CO2 sequestration option can reduce global warming (Fig. 4), and therefore reduce climate change damages and improve the weighted sum of present and future welfare (Eq. 8). A technology that would provide a feasible CO2 sequestration option can hence have an economic value. We use our model to derive order of magnitude estimates for the economic value of sequestration over a wide range of initial marginal costs and reservoir half-life times (Fig. 5). The value of the CO2 sequestration technology is estimated by the maximum amount a social planner would have been willing to pay in 2005 for such a CO2 sequestration option. The value of a CO2 sequestration technology is high when sequestration is relatively cheap and the reservoir half-life times are large. For example, the economic value of a CO2 sequestration technology with costs of 100 U.S.$ per ton C and a millennium reservoir half-life time is on the order often percent ofpresent-day GWP. In other words, an investment equivalent to several percent of present GWP (as a one-time investment) that would have delivered such a CO2 sequestration technology would have passed a cost-benefit test in our model. The benefits of CO2 sequestration can justify a subsidy for this technology in the optimal economic growth model. This is illustrated by the optimal marginal abatement and sequestration costs for the case of sequestration from point sources (Fig. 6). In this example, CO2 sequestration is used even if it is (initially) more expensive than CO2 abatement. The use of the more expensive CO2 sequestration option is optimal in the model because learning-by-doing considerably reduces the unit costs for the relatively new technology.",346.897444

The simple analytical model, however, neglects the effects of (1) learning-by-doing, (2) technological inertia, (3) potential changes in optimal carbon taxes due to the availability of the backstop technology, and (4) potential change in the value of fossil fuel resources due to the additional energy requirements of CO2 sequestration. We use the numerical model introduced above to analyze these effects. In the BAU scenario (i.e., without abatement or sequestration) the CO2 emissions increase from roughly nine Gt C /a in 2015 to around 20 Gt C /a in 2100 (Fig. 2a,c). With CO2 abatement and sequestration available, CO2 abatement generally increases slowly with time. The total amount of abatement (e.g., around one and two Gt C /a in 2015 and 2100 for the case of sequestration from point sources) is a relatively small fraction of the BAU emissions. In contrast, CO2 sequestration expands much faster and captures a large fraction of the BAU emissions. For CO2 sequestration from point sources, the sequestration flux is limited by the total produced CO2 flux (Fig. 2a,b). As a result, the net CO2 emissions due to industrial activities stay roughly constant for the next four decades and then decline to rather small fluxes (mostly driven by CO2 leakage, cf. Fig. 2a) in the second half of this century. In contrast, when CO2 sequestration from air is used (Fig. 2c,d), CO2 emissions continue to grow over the considered time horizon. However, since the amount of sequestered CO2 is not constrained to that of emissions, the optimal CO2 sequestration fluxes from air can be considerably larger than the optimal CO2 sequestration fluxes from point sources.",345.850704

These sensitivities can be explained by observing that increasing monetary discount rates and decreasing leakage and carbon tax growth rates all reduce the discounted costs of future CO2 leakage. Reducing the discounted costs of future CO2 leakage increases the economic efficiencies of CO2 sequestration in the model. Increasing discount rates increases the efficiency factor by lessening the present-value costs associated with future leakage. Decreasing energy penalties increase the efficiency factor by decreasing the overall CO2 production and hence future CO2 leakage flux. Decreasing leakage rates increase the efficiency factor by allowing carbon to escape sequestration later, when the discounted costs due to leakage are lower. Finally, decreasing carbon tax growth rate increases the efficiency by decreasing the cost of cutting emissions to compensate for leaked CO2. The analytical model (Eq. 7) can also be used to derive illustrative estimates of the economic efficiency of CO2 sequestration accounting for the approximated effects of the energy penalty, the monetary discount rate, and the future carbon tax growth rate. To this end, we consider a monetary discount rate of 4% per year and a carbon tax growth rate of 1.75% per year to represent typical values from relatively simple economic optimal growth models (Keller et al. 2005; Nordhaus 2007). CO2 sequestration by afforestation may be approximated using a small energy penalty of 10% and a half-life time of sequestered CO2 of 30 years, yielding an efficiency factor of approximately 40% (Fig. 1). For comparison, a very approximate representation of deep aquifer sequestration with a half-life time of 1000 years and an energy penalty of 15% (Thambimuthu et al. 2005) would have an efficiency factor exceeding 90%.",345.83005

We adopt this value as a simple approximation for technological inertia according to: where αSeq is the maximum growth rate of 7.5% per year, and uð2005Þ 0:01. For sequestration out of air we consider a higher feasible rate growth rate of αSeq=10% per year, so the inertia constraint is with Sð2005Þ 1 Gt C.

We assume a progress ratio of 85% to represent technologies between the research and development phase and the commercialization phase (Grübler et al. 1999), and an initial installed capacity of 1 Gt C to represent a relatively immature technology. We also implement learning-by-doing for CO2 abatement. The cost of abatement decreases from its initial value in DICE-07 according to similar equations to Eqs. 31–33. CO2 abatement is arguably more mature than CO2 sequestration. This is because a key approach to avoiding CO2 emissions is through technologies that increase energy use efficiency. We hence represent the more mature technologies of CO2 abatement with an initially higher cumulative capacity (than that of CO2 sequestration) of 10 Gt C. It is important to stress that representing the complex processes driving the marginal costs of technologies by a simple model based on an exponential relationship with only three parameters is a crude approximation (cf. Wing 2006; Nemet 2006, and Clarke et al. 2006). Learning-by-doing can introduce local maxima into the underlying optimization problem (Manne and Barreto 2004; Messner 1997). A gradient-based optimization method can then be trapped by a local maximum. We solve this problem by applying an evolutionary algorithm (Storn and Price 1997) This approach is conceptually simpler than the method discussed by Kverndokk and Rosendah (2007), but does require nontrivial computational resources. We further reduce the dimension of the optimization problem to decrease the solution time as described in McInerney and Keller (2007). Specifically, we first optimize the control variable of investment in capital stock with BAU CO2 emissions. We then fix this trajectory of investment in capital stock and optimize the CO2 control option (i.e., CO2 abatement and sequestration).",345.959744

In addition, cost estimates depend on factors affected by the base-line, such as the relative prices of fossil fuel sources (Herzog et al. 2005). The recent report on carbon capture and storage from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (Herzog et al. 2005) concludes that a carbon price of roughly 100 U.S.$ per ton C would render CO2 sequestration competitive with other large scale mitigation options. Cost estimates for specific technological approaches vary widely, ranging from tens to more than one thousand U.S.$ per ton C. For example, Chiesa and Consonni (2000) analyze natural gas-fired combined cycle power plants and estimate that carbon taxes between roughly 125 to 180 U.S.$ per ton C would render the CO2 sequestration option competitive. CO2 sequestration from power plants to form thermodynamically stable minerals would be considerably more expensive, with cost estimates exceeding 1000 U.S.$ per ton C (Gerdemann et al. 2007).

We will return to this ratio in the discussion of the numerical model below. This simple efficiency model is a stylized representation of the complex interactions between sequestration and human welfare. However, such a framework may be preferable to alternative weighting schemes that neglect important issues such as the marginal productivity of capital or CO2 leakage beyond an arbitrarily chosen time horizon (Costa and Wilson 2000; Fearnside et al. 2000). Although this analytical model gives us some insight into the economic efficiency of substituting CO2 sequestration for CO2 abatement, it has several shortcomings. First, the partial equilibrium assumption implicit in the fixed carbon tax path is reasonable only for very small-scale use of CO2 sequestration, because large-scale CO2 sequestration would affect the carbon tax path. Second, our analytical model neglects the fact that the carbon tax path is affected by the availability of backstop technologies (House et al. 2006; Manne and Richels 1991), technological inertia (Grübler et al. 1999), learning-by-doing (Argote and Epple 1990) and the additional fossil fuel required for sequestration.

We approximate the leakage by an exponential decay of the sequestered CO2 stock. For example, the leakage from ocean injection can reasonably be approximated by an exponential decay with half-life times ranging from decades to centuries (cf. Herzog et al. 2003). The leakage flux of one ton of sequestered CO2 over time (l) is a function of the decay rate (ζ): where t starts at the time of sequestration and the half-life time of the sequestered CO2 in the reservoir (T1/2) is given by lnð2Þ=K . For the analytical model, we assume an agreed upon atmospheric CO2 stabilization path with an associated path of allowable CO2 emissions. The marginal CO2 abatement costs over time are then a function of the CO2 reductions over time and the available abatement technologies with their associated marginal costs. If we think about the CO2 stabilization path as implemented by the application of an emissions tax, this carbon tax would follow the same path as the marginal abatement costs in the adopted simple framework. For the agreed upon CO2 stabilization path, any leakage has to be compensated by increased abatement. Because CO2 abatement is costly, CO2 leakage imposes additional costs in the future. The additional costs are approximated, in a partial equilibrium sense, by the carbon tax times the leakage flux. Future optimal carbon tax trajectories in economic optimal growth models are reasonably well approximated for the next two centuries by exponential functions over a wide range of climate objectives (Keller et al. 2005; Nordhaus 2007; Yohe et al. 2004). We hence approximate the carbon taxes over time as: where β0 is the initial carbon tax in U.S.$ per ton of carbon (C) and β is the carbon tax growth rate. As discussed above, we assume that the marginal damages of CO2 emissions are equal to the carbon tax. The carbon taxes are projected to increase over time, mostly because of the positive marginal productivity of capital and since the free service of the natural carbon sinks favor later abatement measures. The last assumption required for the analytical model is to discount future costs by a discount factor (d): where r is the monetary discount rate. Deriving the efficiency factor of a leaky CO2 sequestration project is now a matter of calculating the net present value of the project and relating it to the costs of the alternative strategy of abating CO2 emissions. Technically, the net benefit of sequestered CO2 at time zero is the avoided carbon tax (β0) minus the present value of future costs imposed by the CO2 leakage. The net benefits per ton of CO2 sequestered is therefore net benefit ¼ β0 t¼1Zt¼0e rtβ0e βt 1 K 1e K t d t; ð5Þ which can be solved analytically for r þ z b > 0.

A necessary condition for a least-cost strategy is that different CO2 control technologies are used such that their marginal social values (shadow prices) are equalized. Thus, in a world in which sequestration has a constant efficiency (η) relative to that of abatement, and an optimal tax (C) is levied on all CO2 emissions (including those sequestered), the optimal “refund” levied for each ton of CO2 sequestered should be equal to the product η·C. As the relative efficiency of sequestration approaches unity (perfect substitution for abatement), the refund approaches full reimbursement. Conversely, in a credit regime for sequestration, the fraction of a full credit corresponding to the fraction of the social value of abatement, η, should be given for each ton sequestered. The first goal of our analysis is to derive the economic efficiency factor of CO2 sequestration to compare CO2 sequestration and abatement. For example, 100 tons of sequestered CO2 would offset 50 tons of avoided CO2 emissions at an efficiency factor of 50%. To illustrate the structure of the problem, we use a simple analytical model, expanding on the approach discussed by Richards (1997) and refined by Herzog et al (2003). The economic efficiency of CO2 sequestration is affected in our analytical model by four factors: (1) the additional energy requirement, (2) the CO2 leakage over time with associated impacts, (3) the changes over time in marginal abatement costs, and (4) the monetary discount rate. In the following section we develop simple representations of these factors and derive a closed form solution for the efficiency factor of CO2 sequestration. The first factor accounts for the additional energy required for CO2 sequestration, which is derived from burning more fossil fuel, and will be referred to as an “energy penalty”. The relative “energy penalty” (1) is the consequence of the energy-intensive nature of capturing, transporting, and sequestering CO2 emissions and is defined as the proportion of produced energy required for CO2 sequestration. (See Appendix 1 for a definition of symbols.) The relative increase in CO2 emissions that must be sequestered to yield the same amount of energy for end use is",345.948506

Efforts to mitigate the greenhouse gas problem have traditionally focused on abating carbon dioxide (CO2) production by reducing fossil fuel use or switching to less CO2 intense fossil fuels (typically referred to as “CO2 abatement”; Nordhaus 1992; Tol 1997). CO2 abatement, however, requires sizable investments and has to overcome considerable socio-economic inertia (Barker et al. 2007). One alternative to CO2 abatement is CO2 capture and storage (Lackner 2003; Marchetti 1977; Rubin et al. 2005; also referred to as “CO2 sequestration”). CO2 capture can occur from industrial point sources (e.g., from fossil fuel power plants) or from the atmosphere (e.g., through changes in forestry practices or by absorption of CO2 from the air). CO2 sequestration requires additional energy, which, at the current mix of energy sources, depletes fossil fuel resources and increases the amount of produced CO2. Proposed reservoirs for CO2 storage include terrestrial biomass, deep oceans, saline aquifers, and minerals. These reservoirs differ considerably in the rates at which the stored CO2 may leak back to the atmosphere. The characteristic storage times increase from the terrestrial pools (decades to centuries); to the deep oceans (centuries); to geological reservoirs (millennia); to thermodynamically stable minerals (exceeding millennia) (Freund et al. 2005; Lackner 2003). An optimal portfolio of CO2 abatement and sequestration has to account for the relative advantages and disadvantages of CO2 sequestration. Potentially important advantages of CO2 sequestration compared with CO2 abatement include (1) large-scale reductions in anthropogenic CO2 emissions may be cheaper and faster to implement and (2) the marginal CO2 sequestration costs may be reduced faster through investments than marginal abatement costs (as sequestration is a less mature technology). However, sequestration has some disadvantages compared to CO2 abatement. For example, CO2 sequestration may cause future CO2 leaks and can require additional fossil fuel resources. The inter-temporal tradeoffs due to these differences can occur over several centuries, thus requiring nontrivial long-term projections. Here we ask five main questions: (1) What are economically efficient choices between CO2 sequestration and CO2 abatement? (2) What is the optimal use and timing of CO2 sequestration? (3) How does CO2 sequestration change the optimal trajectories of atmospheric CO2 concentrations, global mean temperature, and marginal CO2 abatement costs? (4) How do technological inertia, learning-by-doing, and the energy requirement of CO2 sequestration affect the use of sequestration? and (5) What is the present economic value of a technology that would provide a feasible CO2 sequestration option in the future? To address these questions, we expand and improve on previous work in two main respects. First, we refine and apply an analytical model (Richards 1997) to estimate the efficiency factor of CO2 sequestration. Second, we modify an optimal economic growth model (Nordhaus 2007) by adding CO2 sequestration and learning-by-doing to analyze the optimal use of CO2 sequestration methods and the effects of optimal carbon dioxide levels. Previous studies that have addressed CO2 sequestration have developed elegant analytical expressions for analyzing the question of how much CO2 sequestration should be counted as a substitute for CO2 abatement (e.g., Richards 1997; van Kooten et al. 1997; Herzog et al. 2003), or analyze the optimal use of CO2 sequestration in numerical models (e.g., Swinehart 1996; Riahi et al. 2004; Keith et al. 2006). While breaking important new ground, these studies are silent on important policy questions. For example, the analytical models often neglect the effects of the additional energy required for CO2 sequestration (Herzog et al. 2003). We expand on the groundbreaking work of Richards (1997) and Herzog et al. (2003) by (1) considering the effects of the energy required for CO2 sequestration, (2) deriving a closed form solution to the economic efficiency of CO2 sequestration, and (3) demonstrating with a numerical model that the positive economic impacts of learning-by-doing and the alleviation of future inertia constraints can dominate the negative economic impacts due to leakage. We expand on previous numerical analysis by focusing on sequestration technologies that may allow large reductions in atmospheric CO2 concentrations and by considering a longer time-horizon. Many numerical models focus on afforestation, which seems unlikely to be a cost effective and feasible strategy for deep cuts in net anthropogenic CO2 emissions to the atmosphere (Adam 2001; Benitez et al. 2007; Nilsson and Schopehauser 1995; Sohngen and Sedjo 2006). Studies analyzing more powerful sequestration methods, such as deep-aquifer injection or absorption into minerals, either assume negligible marginal costs (Nordhaus 1992), neglect induced technological change (Herzog et al. 2003), or do not analyze the effects of CO2 leakage (Gerlagh 2006; Keith et al. 2006). Our study additionally contributes to methodological development by demonstrating a reliable and relatively fast method to overcome the convergence problems posed by the potential nonconvexity of the optimal control problem that is arguably simpler than previous approaches (Kverndokk and Rosendah 2007). We characterize the economic efficiency of CO2 sequestration by the ratio of the marginal benefits of CO2 sequestration and CO2 abatement. We derive an analytical expression for this economic efficiency for an extremely simplified case that accounts for CO2 leakage, changes in future carbon taxes, the energy requirements of CO2 sequestration, and discounting. Specifically, we estimate the net present value of sequestered CO2 in terms of avoided abatement costs required to meet a given climate objective. CO2 sequestration can replace costly abatement measures in the present and hence has an economic value. However, leaky CO2 sequestration imposes future costs. The net savings (i.e., the initial savings minus the future costs) relative to the initial savings represent the economic efficiency factor of CO2 sequestration. The results from our analytical model suggest that afforestation can have negative to slightly positive economic efficiencies, while long-term sequestration possibilities, such as deep aquifer sequestration or ocean injection, would be much more efficient. The analytical model provides an intuitive and simple method, but it neglects potentially important effects of learning-by-doing (Argote and Epple 1990), technological inertia (Grübler et al. 1999), and a limited fossil fuel resource base (Herzog et al. 2003). We analyze these effects using a numerical optimal growth model. We adopt a globally aggregated model of optimal economic growth (DICE-07) that represents, in a highly stylized manner, anthropogenic climate change, the associated economic impacts, and strategies to control these impacts (Nordhaus 2007). The choice of this parsimonious model structure is motivated by the need to analyze feedbacks that act over several centuries. Choosing more complex model structures (cf. Schwoon and Tol 2006 or Manne and Barreto 2004) has the potential to provide more detailed insights into the dynamics over the next few decades. Whether increasing the model complexity would actually improve the projection skill over the century-scale time horizon of the problem, is, however, an open question (Craig et al. 2002; Keller et al. 2007). Nonetheless, the simplicity of the model imposes potentially severe caveats. We return to these caveats below. For the numerical analysis, we amend the DICE-07 model with extremely simplistic representations of CO2 sequestration, technological inertia, and learning-by-doing. We overcome the methodological challenge of a potentially non-convex objective function introduced by learning-by-doing (Arrow 1962; Manne and Barreto 2004) by using an efficient global optimization algorithm (Storn and Price 1997). One key finding from the numerical analysis is that the positive economic impacts due to learning-by-doing and the mitigation of future inertia constraints can dominate the negative economic impacts due to leakage and the additional energy requirements. As a result, the marginal CO2 sequestration costs can considerably exceed the marginal CO2 abatement costs along an optimal path. The economic efficiencies of CO2 sequestration can hence exceed 100%. In this case, it is a profitable strategy in the adopted optimal growth framework to subsidize (“buy-down”) the costs of CO2 sequestration. In the model, CO2 sequestration at marginal costs within the range of present estimates is deployed in increasing volume to sequester a large fraction of the anthropogenic CO2 emissions within this century. The economic value of a feasible CO2 sequestration technology can be several percent of present-day gross world product (GWP). We explore the sensitivity of our results with respect to parametric assumptions about learning-by-doing, technological inertia, and CO2 leakage.",346.92675

However, CO2 sequestration is not a perfect substitute for CO2 abatement because CO2 may leak back into the atmosphere (thus imposing future climate change impacts) and because CO2 sequestration requires energy (thus producing more CO2 and depleting fossil fuel resources earlier). Here we use analytical and numerical models to assess the economic efficiency of CO2 sequestration and analyze the optimal timing and extent of CO2 sequestration. The economic efficiency factor of CO2 sequestration can be expressed as the ratio of the marginal net benefits of sequestering CO2 and avoiding CO2 emissions. We derive an analytical solution for this efficiency factor for a simplified case in which we account for CO2 leakage, discounting, the additional fossil fuel requirement of CO2 sequestration, and the growth rate of carbon taxes. In this analytical model, the economic efficiency of CO2 sequestration decreases as the CO2 tax growth rate, leakage rates and energy requirements for CO2 sequestration increase. Increasing discount rates increases the economic efficiency factor. In this simple model, short-term sequestration methods, such as afforestation, can even have negative economic efficiencies. We use a more realistic integrated-assessment model to additionally account for potentially important effects such as learning-by-doing and socio-economic inertia on optimal strategies. We measure the economic efficiency of CO2 sequestration by the ratio of the marginal costs of CO2 sequestration and CO2 abatement along optimal trajectories. We show that the positive impacts of investments in CO2 sequestration through the reduction of future marginal CO2 sequestration costs and the alleviation of future inertia constraints can initially exceed the marginal sequestration costs. As a result, the economic efficiencies of CO2 sequestration can exceed 100% and an optimal strategy will subsidize CO2 sequestration that is initially more expensive than CO2 abatement. The potential economic value of a feasible and acceptable CO2 sequestration technology is equivalent – in the adopted utilitarian model to a one-time investment of several percent of present gross world product. It is optimal in the chosen economic framework to sequester substantial CO2 quantities into reservoirs with small or zero leakage, given published estimates of marginal costs and climate change impacts. The optimal CO2 trajectories in the case of sequestration from air can approach the pre-industrial level, constituting geoengineering. Our analysis is silent on important questions (e.g., the effects of model and parametric uncertainty, the potential learning about these uncertainties, or ethical dimension of such geoengineering strategies), which need to be addressed before our findings can be translated into policy-relevant recommendations.",346.89847

This representation enables us to vary the effectiveness of ITC across scenarios and also to make ITC differentially effective for emission intensity technologies and carbon-free technologies. Under the assumption that emission intensity technologies represent incremental changes that are more responsive to carbon price signals, the base case parameterization assumes that ITC is stronger for emission intensity technologies than for carbon-free technologies. It remains to define cost functions for abatement, NET deployment, and public R&D targets. First, the cost of abatement depends on the level of abatement and on available technologies. c(μt, αt, γt) is the average cost in the base case of abating fraction μt of BAU emissions et given R&D outcomes αt and γt: c(μt, αt, γt) = { mmiinn [[ ztμμzttt d̃d ((zztt)) ,, ((11 −− ααtt))dd̃((μμtt))]] ffoorr lboawse-ccoassteaabbaatetemmeenntt cost (14) where zt ≡ max [(μt − γt)/(1 − γt), 0] as in Baker and Adu-Bonnah (2008). The top expression holds for the base case parameterization and for most others, but the two parameterizations with low-cost abatement use the bottom expression. Both expressions give abatement cost with time t technology as a function of abatement cost with initial technology, but they differ in the function (d(·) or d̃(·)) used to assign the cost with initial technology. In either case, zero abatement costs nothing (d(0) = d̃(0) = 0), and the normalization is d(1) = 100. The range of c(·) is [0,100]. The two terms inside the minimization operators give the effect of emission intensity technologies and carbon-free technologies, and the use of the minimization operator assumes that the cheapest type of technology is used at each level of abatement (compare Blyth et al. 2009). Hoogwijk et al. (2008) reported the carbon price yielding aggregate global abatement of 25% to be between $10/tCO2 and $40/tCO2 and the carbon price yielding aggregate global abatement of 50% to be between $60/tCO2 and some level well above $100/tCO2. We develop the base case and the low-cost average cost representations by assuming that marginal costs follow a geometric progression at the discretized points and increase linearly between those points.  This yields the normalized values:",345.838747

Second, we require “perfect” ITC to translate a given percentage abatement into R&D targets that are the same percentage of their maximal levels. This implies that μ = ITCα(μ)/ᾱ = ITCγ (μ)/γ̄ under perfect ITC. A parameter ν controls the effectiveness of ITC and proxies for the severity of innovation market failures.

These outcomes are each drawn from a three-point probability distribution similar to the one in Baker and Adu-Bonnah (2008). The main differences are that here the distribution is anchored by the previous period’s realized outcome and that here the targeted level of technology depends not just on the previous period’s R&D funding but also on its abatement policy. Abatement can induce technological change via functions ITCα : μt → [0, ᾱ] for carbon-free R&D and ITCγ : μt → [0, γ̄] for emission intensity R&D. ITC may occur through private R&D or through learning-by-doing. The technology target for a given period comes from summing the targets produced by abatement via ITC and by public R&D, provided the total target does not exceed the exogenously fixed maximal level. The three possibilities are that technology does not change, that the technology target is attained, and that the technology target is surpassed to yield the best possible outcome: ",345.865973

These levels of medium-term abatement are consistent with the most ambitious goals announced by major emitters (e.g., UNFCCC 2011). The optimal level of near-term abatement is sensitive to CO2 targets and to judgments about NETs’ cost, risk, and availability, but it is not sensitive to the availability of policies that aim to directly spur clean energy R&D. Because the translation of emissions into temperature is uncertain, announced 2◦C temperature limits can only be met with some probability (e.g., Meinshausen et al. 2009). If policymakers accept that the target may be met with less than a 50% chance, then our middle emission constraint might be adopted. In this case, announced 2◦C temperature limits imply that emissions over the next half-century should be 50% lower than the BAU path. If policymakers require a greater than 50% chance of meeting the 2◦C temperature limit, then our most stringent emission constraint is the more relevant one. With this most stringent constraint, either maximal abatement effort must begin immediately or the policymaker limits nearer-term emission reductions to around 50% while planning for prodigious deployment of NETs later in the century (compare van Vuuren and Riahi 2011). While the availability of technology policies generally does not affect abatement paths, these policies can greatly reduce the cost of the optimal policy portfolio (Fig. 1). Technology policies should emphasize carbon-free technologies if large-scale NET deployment is not viable even though science and policy call for strict emission constraints; technology policies should emphasize emission intensity technologies if NETs are expected to play a large role later this century. Technology policies are not guaranteed to succeed, but their payoffs are asymmetric: failure leaves future abatement cost unchanged while success lowers it (Bosetti and Tavoni 2009). Importantly, the effect of technology policies and of NETs on the cost of the policy portfolio has additional significance in a benefit-cost setting where a lower policy cost for a given climate outcome can justify reducing endogenous cumulative emissions. We only consider worlds with and without NETs, but policymakers in a world without NETs might be able to purchase them. Two factors increase the value of purchasing a NET option. First, if emission constraints are stringent, then we have seen that NETs significantly reduce the cost of the optimal policy portfolio. Second, if the policymaker expects to learn about climate change over time, then NETs’ ability to make emissions at least partially reversible confers greater ability to take advantage of future learning (compare Pindyck 2002; Fisher and Narain 2003). Different policy instruments provide different incentives for NET development: a cap-and-trade program only values NETs as offsets and provides no incentive for net negative emissions over a trading period, while a carbon tax can incentivize net negative emissions if deployed NETs receive tax credits or carbon payments (i.e., if a linear tax is linear over the whole range of emissions rather than only over positive emissions). The importance of incentives for NET development depends in part on the value of obtaining a NET option. Three types of research could improve our model’s applicability. First, near-term interdisciplinary research into the possible costs, scale, and land use implications of NETs could not only improve the current model but could enable future policy decisions to respond to the new information about NETs (e.g., van Vuuren et al. 2009; Luckow et al. 2010; van Vuuren et al. 2010a). In fact, R&D to reduce NETs’ cost from the baseline estimate almost always precedes deployment of NETs in the current model, though it does not appear to be necessary for such deployment. Because NET deployment is valuable for its ability to substitute for abatement, our model’s results are necessarily sensitive to NETs’ capacity and to the relative cost of abatement and of NET deployment. Second, different functions for probabilistically connecting R&D support and abatement policies to technological outcomes could provide more realistic representations of technological change. These connections could be developed by expert elicitation (e.g., Baker et al. 2009) or by extrapolation from past experience (e.g., Nemet 2006). However, any such function will remain subject to substantial structural uncertainty when applied to the attempt to shape future energy technology. This observation leads to the third important research path: the portfolio selection model might produce stronger and more detailed policy implications if, beyond its current consideration of parametric uncertainty, it also accounted for structural uncertainty about functional forms and probability distributions. This kind of sensitivity analysis would require either a simpler model or a larger cluster of computers to run the current model, but especially if evaluated with algorithms for supervised learning (Hastie et al. 2009), it could provide a more complete depiction of the connection between policy outcomes and possible factors governing abatement cost and technological change. The climate and the economy are both complex systems whose evolution over century-long timescales is subject to particularly difficult forms of uncertainty. However, because CO2 accumulates in the atmosphere and investments in energy infrastructure tend to be long-lived, the climate policies adopted over the next decades play a large role in determining how much flexibility remains later in the century to respond to the realized climate and economy. Any climate policy portfolio implicitly places bets on the climatic and economic systems, but some portfolios imply more specific bets than do others and impose greater costs if their bets turn out poorly. We have taken a step towards representing the policy implications of different types of bets and towards determining which policies cohere with the broadest range of bets. We find that deep intermediate- and long-term abatement is robust to the scenarios considered here, but near-term abatement and R&D funding decisions depend on CO2 goals and on the anticipated availability of NETs. NETs affect optimal abatement paths if the CO2 target is near or below present CO2 concentrations. In that case, these options can greatly reduce the social cost of the policy portfolio, and they shift some near-term funding for abatement and for carbon-free R&D into funding for R&D targeted towards emission intensity technologies and towards reducing the cost of NETs. Future NET deployment can greatly facilitate the achievement of stringent CO2 targets and can partially compensate for excess emissions over the next years (Obersteiner et al. 2001). However, depending on future large-scale NET use can be a brittle strategy: NETs and long-term CO2 storage carry their own risks, and future use of NETs may not help with nearer-term climate thresholds and other irreversible changes. The availability of NETs provides a valuable option to partially undo previous emissions, but abatement also gains option value from increasing future flexibility to forgo reliance on NETs if the technology or climate prove problematic in the interim.",346.051812

We see the first two effects in our results. In a world with a 390 ppm CO2 constraint but without NETs, the parameterization with “perfect” ITC is the only one that does not have public funding for carbon-free R&D. Furthermore, variations in the effectiveness of ITC generally also account for the minor variation in the level of public R&D funding. More interestingly, when the CO2 constraint is at its least stringent so that there is more room to reallocate abatement over time, we see greater near-term abatement in the parameterizations with better ITC. This occurs in order to improve technology for use in later abatement efforts. In sum, we see stronger ITC decreasing R&D funding and increasing near-term abatement, but this only happens under some conditions because ITC is not a dominant factor in our parameterizations. Finally, the policy environment and emission constraint determine many of the remaining details about the optimal course of action, regardless of the parameter values examined. In a world without NETs, one can almost perfectly predict each period’s abatement if one knows the CO2 constraint and nothing else about the parameterization under consideration. The availability of NETs tends to reduce the importance of the CO2 constraint for the determination of abatement levels and abatement R&D decisions because NETs can make the more stringent constraints’ abatement goals behave more like those needed for less stringent constraints. In a world without NETs, the emission target selected for climate policy almost completely determines immediate abatement and R&D decisions, and in a world with NETs, the emission target determines whether NETs are relevant. Further, the possibility of NET use allows the precise level of period 3 abatement (as opposed to the broad categories in Fig. 3) under the two more stringent CO2 constraints to be contingent on abatement R&D outcomes and on NET R&D outcomes. For instance, if abatement R&D is not successful while NET R&D is successful, NET deployment can be scaled up and abatement can be scaled down. Because they reduce the probability of undertaking the deepest levels of period 2 and period 3 abatement, available NETs reduce the incentive to invest in carbon-free R&D and increase the incentive to invest in emission intensity R&D. NETs and emission intensity R&D thus act as complements, both substituting for carbon-free R&D and for abatement. Carbon-free R&D is driven by anticipation of deep abatement in the future, and abatement is driven by the cumulative emission constraint. However, NETs effectively truncate abatement cost: they substitute for all abatement beyond their marginal cost, and they therefore increase the value of R&D into emission intensity technology that more strongly affects cost when abatement is lower.",345.861312

R&D options provide their greatest cost reductions in percentage terms for weaker CO2 constraints while NETs provide their greatest cost reductions for stricter constraints. R&D options provide their greatest percentage cost reductions for the weaker CO2 constraints because these constraints permit greater flexibility in the timing of abatement and so allow abatement to be adjusted to take advantage of R&D outcomes. In the base case parameterization, including options to undertake R&D reduces the expected cost of meeting the 390 ppm constraint by almost 25%, reduces the expected cost of meeting the 435 ppm constraint by 55%, and reduces the expected cost of meeting the 550 ppm constraint by around 65%. In contrast, NETs provide their greatest expected cost reductions for the strictest CO2 constraints because they then replace more expensive abatement. Including options to deploy NETs reduces the expected cost of the 390 ppm constraint by almost a further 80%, reduces the expected cost of the 435 ppm constraint by a further 35%, and does not further reduce the expected cost of the 550 ppm constraint. In the base case parameterization with NETs, the policy portfolio for the 390 ppm constraint costs about as much as the portfolio with R&D options for the 435 ppm constraint and about twice as much as the abatement-only portfolio for the 550 ppm constraint. However, when scientific findings lead policymakers to require that the emission constraint never be crossed, NETs provide less value because there is less flexibility to reallocate emissions over time. Portfolio costs for the two more stringent constraints vary widely among parameterizations, as shown by the error bars in Fig. 1. In all cases, the parameterizations that produce the most expensive policy portfolios are the parameterization without discounting and the parameterization that limits the maximal scope of technological advance. The lack of discounting increases the present cost of late-century deep abatement, and limiting the scope of technological advance increases the expected cost of late-century abatement and NET deployment. In most cases, the two parameterizations that yield the lowest-cost policy portfolios are the parameterization with high discounting and the parameterization with low-cost abatement, low-cost R&D, and low-cost NETs. However, the most stringent (390 ppm) CO2 constraint is a bit different. Here, if NETs are unavailable, the optimal portfolio in the parameterization with low-cost abatement is cheaper than the optimal portfolio in the parameterization with high discounting; if NETs are available and temporary overshoots are allowed, the optimal portfolio in the parameterization with high discounting is cheaper because a large fraction of the costs result from the final period’s heavy use of NETs; and if temporary overshoots are not allowed, the optimal portfolio in the parameterization with low-cost NETs is cheaper than the optimal portfolio in the parameterization with high discounting because NETs would be used in earlier periods. The presence of R&D and NET options can affect not just the cost of the policy portfolio but also the optimal emission path. The lines with squares in Fig. 2 show the optimal emission path if the only policy option is to undertake abatement. The lines with circles show the BAU emission path, which is scenario-independent. Each solid line represents the optimal gross emission path (i.e., before subtracting NETs’ removed emissions) in the modeled parameterizations, with the thickness of a line proportional to the number of represented parameterizations. Comparing the solid lines to the one with squares shows how including a set of policy options changes the emission path relative to a case in which the only policy option is for abatement. Comparing solid lines across columns shows the effect on optimal emissions of including additional policy options or climate threshold constraints. Finally, comparing solid lines across rows shows the effect of the CO2 constraint on optimal emissions. Some have argued that technology policies should be the primary component of near-term climate policy (e.g., Sandén and Azar 2005; Montgomery and Smith 2007). Our model would support this argument if making public R&D policies available shifted abatement from earlier periods to later ones. Instead, the left column in Fig. 2 shows that this model’s planned abatement paths are relatively insensitive to the availability of public R&D options, even though those options are exercised and do reduce portfolio costs. While Goulder and Mathai (2000) found that the availability of R&D options should affect optimal abatement, we find a small effect on abatement in part because we limit abatement to five discrete levels. R&D’s expected effect on the cost of future abatement is high enough to justify undertaking it, but it is not high enough to reshuffle the intertemporal allocation of abatement between these five levels. In contrast, comparing the left column with the middle column shows that NET options do affect optimal emission paths: with the 435 ppm CO2 constraint (middle row), making NETs available allows more smoothing of gross emissions over time by offsetting the most expensive late-century abatement, and with the 390 ppm CO2 constraint (bottom row), NETs’ availability decreases both near-term and long-term abatement by enabling future NET deployment to offset increased emissions from earlier periods.  The graphs for the 550 ppm constraint do not change, reflecting the insensitivity of emissions to NET options with a lax CO2 constraint. Finally, comparing the right column with the middle column shows the influence of concerns about climate tipping points on optimal emission paths. Now the scenarios with the 390 ppm constraint (bottom row) increase both abatement and NET deployment in the first period so that CO2 concentrations do not temporarily overshoot the target value. Therefore, while NET options can reduce optimal near-term abatement, the magnitude of this effect is sensitive to whether emissions and CO2 concentrations may temporarily overshoot their year 2100 constraints. In a stylized model such as the present one, the details of the control variables are less important than the big-picture story they represent. In Fig. 3, we group cost-minimizing policy outcomes according to the probability with which they produce at least 25% abatement in the first period, at least 50% abatement in the second period, 100% abatement in the third period, public funding for carbon-free R&D in any period, public funding for emission intensity R&D in any period, and deployment of NETs in any period. A probability strictly between 0 and 1 reflects that optimal policies depend on realizations of stochastic technology. Interestingly, the probability of undertaking these broad categories of actions generally splits into probabilities near 1 and near 0. This indicates that big-picture actions are not sensitive to technological outcomes, instead being driven mostly by the CO2 constraint. The type of R&D funded depends on how much it may contribute to the broad categories of actions favored by a given combination of CO2 constraint and available policy options: carbon-free public R&D and emission intensity public R&D often substitute for each other, with expectations of future abatement largely driving the choice between the two types of technology forcing. In a subtle difference from the conclusions of Gerlagh et al. (2009) and of the review by Baker and Shittu (2008), near-term abatement and public R&D funding do not clearly substitute for each other with a given emission constraint and our discretized policy levels. Rather, near-term abatement is primarily determined by whether it is needed to keep future CO2 concentrations below the constraint, not by the availability of R&D policies, which in turn are adopted without reducing near-term abatement. Near-term abatement is affected more by the availability of NETs than by the availability of R&D policies. Some policy choices are not sensitive to climate targets or to parameters’ values. For example, the optimal portfolio usually abates at least 50% of period 2 BAU emissions and at least 75% of period 3 BAU emissions in nearly all parameterizations (Figs. 2 and 3). Furthermore, public funding for R&D is rarely above half of the maximal level.  Unless the CO2 constraint is a strict threshold or there is no discounting, NETs are almost never used before period 3 or without previous NET R&D. A robust course of action therefore plans for deep abatement from 2030-2100, includes public R&D support that is significant but not a substitute for early abatement, and deploys NETs only after deep abatement and in conjunction with ongoing deep abatement. The outliers in Fig. 3 tell their own interesting stories. First, carbon-free R&D is the only category of action that often occurs with a probability strictly between 0 and 1. This happens when NETs are available or when the CO2 constraint is at its least stringent (550 ppm). Each of these cases requires relatively low future abatement, leading the policymaker to fund emission intensity R&D in period 1. Carbon-free R&D then occurs in period 2 if the emission intensity R&D from period 1 did not have much success and period 1 abatement did not induce much technological change. Second, cases with uncertain NET deployment reveal the interaction of stochastic technology and abatement cost. Increasing the scope for technological change decreases the probability of NET deployment to 0.9 with the 390 ppm constraint and to 0.1 with the 435 ppm constraint because it decreases the expected cost of period 3 abatement. The parameterizations with limited control over technological change and with low-cost abatement also decrease the probability of NET use with the 435 ppm constraint. Relatedly, the two isolated parameterizations that generally produce 100% abatement in period 3 with the 435 ppm constraint are those with greater scope for technological change and with low-cost abatement. These two parameterizations lead optimal policy to forgo NET deployment in favor of increasing period 3 abatement. The final insights from the outliers in Fig. 3 concern the effect of ITC. In the three parameterizations that make ITC stronger, abatement is more successful at producing technological change independently of public R&D policies. This pushes policy in at least three directions. First, near-term abatement could increase as it now provides an additional benefit. Second, near-term R&D could decrease since abatement has become relatively more effective at producing technological change.",345.84474

To the extent that 21st century temperature change is determined by 21st century cumulative emissions, temporary overshoots are consistent with the temperature limit that motivates constraining cumulative emissions. In this case, we have S = {3}. The freedom to temporarily overshoot the cumulative emission constraint only matters in a world with NETs, because cumulative emissions otherwise cannot decrease. However, using NETs to temporarily overshoot a cumulative emission constraint could cause additional irreversible changes or spur tipping points (O’Neill and Oppenheimer 2004; Lenton et al. 2008). It is therefore also of interest to consider a world with NETs but where climate science indicates that a threshold would be crossed if cumulative emissions exceed e∗.7 In this case, we have S = {1, 2, 3}, which requires the cumulative emission constraint to be met in each period rather than only in the final period. The Appendix describes the three-point probability distributions that determine the technology outcomes (αt, γt, and φt) that apply to period t. It also describes how abatement induces technological change and defines the cost functions for abatement, NET deployment, and public R&D targets. Induced technological change here includes all private R&D and learning-by-doing that occur in response to an abatement policy. It does not include technological change due to public R&D policies, which are decision variables, or to spillovers, which are not modeled (see Clarke et al. 2008). We solve the model by working backwards through the graph of all possible states. Each of the 15 parameterizations (see Table 3 in the Appendix) is run under each of 9 combinations of the constraints on cumulative emissions and available policy options (Table 2). Each model run yields the optimal policy portfolio in each period conditional on previous technological outcomes and on previous abatement and NET policies. Comparing model runs reveals the importance of R&D and negative emission options, of the CO2 constraint, and of other key parameters. It also refines intuition about how policy options interact. Because the parameterizations are not fully calibrated to empirical work, and because the correct process and distribution for technological change cannot be known in advance, the model’s results should not be read as recommending specific levels for the policy variables. The goal is instead to assess the robustness of optimal portfolios and the crucial parameters for determining those portfolios.",346.08504

In each period, the decision-maker observes the current technology and optimizes accordingly. The periods correspond to 2010–2029, 2030–2049, and 2050–2099, which roughly match the near-term, intermediate-term, and long-term periods for which CO2 emission goals are often discussed. Scenarios vary the planner’s access to certain types of policies by varying the possible levels that each decision variable may take (Table 2). μt gives the fraction of business-as-usual (BAU) emissions et abated in period t, and κt gives the quantity (Gt CO2) of NETs deployed. Carbon-free technology reduces abatement cost by a fraction αt, and emission intensity technology reduces non-abated emissions by a fraction γt (Baker and Adu-Bonnah 2008). Carbon-free technology is relatively more valuable at high levels of abatement when abatement cost is correspondingly high. As an example, consider battery and renewable generation breakthroughs for all-electric vehicles. Emission intensity technology is relatively more valuable at lower levels of abatement when there are more non-abated emissions. As an example, consider powertrain technology that promotes gasoline-electric hybrid vehicles. R&D into NETs can reduce the cost of deploying NETs by a fraction φt. The average cost of abatement (c(·)) depends on the fraction of BAU emissions abated (μt) and on the outcomes of previous R&D into carbon-free technologies (αt) and emission intensity technologies (γt). The cost of NETs ( f(·)) depends on the level of deployment (κt) and on the outcome of past R&D efforts (φt). R&D funding (g(·), h(·), and j(·)) is determined by the chosen public R&D targets, and the total technology target for a period is determined by the public R&D target and by abatement policies’ induced technological change (ITC, see Appendix). The discount factor β converts costs from their value at the beginning of the period in which they are incurred to their value in the prior year. Abatement, R&D, and NET deployment is motivated by the cumulative CO2 emission constraint e∗. Cumulative emissions are a robust indicator of total temperature change (Allen et al. 2009; Matthews et al. 2009; National Research Council 2011). As CO2 concentrations are a conventional way of framing climate policy, we also convert each of these cumulative emission constraints to a year 2100 CO2 concentration by assuming a constant airborne fraction of 0.45 (Denman et al. 2007). We model three values for e∗ (Table 2): 88 Gt CO2 (390 ppm), 880 Gt CO2 (435 ppm), and 2900 Gt CO2 (550 ppm). If there are no further CO2 emissions, these cumulative emissions ultimately produce temperature change of 1◦C, 2.5◦C, and 6◦C, respectively, under the best estimate from National Research Council (2011). If, instead, emissions continue past 2100 at a level that stabilizes the CO2 concentration at its year 2100 value, then the 550 ppm constraint corresponds to requiring a 90% chance of keeping temperature change below 4◦C, the 435 ppm constraint corresponds to requiring a 95% chance of keeping temperature change below 4◦C, and the 390 ppm constraint corresponds to requiring a 90% chance of keeping temperature change below 2◦C (Lemoine 2010). BAU emissions et (in Gt CO2) come from scenario A2r in the International Institute for Applied System Analysis (IIASA) GGI Scenario Database (see also Riahi et al. 2007).5 Summing over each period’s years yields:",345.84775

Combining several types of policy options in one model enables interactions that might not be apparent otherwise. The decision-maker selects the most cost-effective policy plan for meeting a predetermined emission goal. These policy plans are contingent on low-carbon technological outcomes drawn from probability distributions determined by R&D funding and by abatement. In reality, global climate policy emerges from a game played among many decision-makers with complex objectives, but the case with a single decision-maker provides one benchmark for establishing and assessing climate policies.  In order to gain intuition for how these policy options interact, we compare results for three emission constraints and for four worlds: one world in which the only policy option is to reduce emissions; one world in which abatement and public R&D are both available options; one world in which abatement, public R&D, and NET research and deployment are all available options; and a final world in which all these options are available but temporarily overshooting the emission constraint is not allowed.

Because the world may have already used up roughly half of the resulting carbon budget since 1750 (Allen et al. 2009), staying within the remaining carbon budget would prove challenging even with aggressive near-term abatement (e.g., van Vuuren et al. 2007). This challenge is further exacerbated as countries delay abatement (Clarke et al. 2009; Krey and Riahi 2009). The dissonance between climate goals and action has spurred recent interest in additional ways of managing temperature outcomes (e.g., Keith 2009; Lenton and Vaughan 2009; Blackstock and Long 2010; Kintisch 2010). First, geoengineering techniques might reduce the temperature increase resulting from a CO2 emission path by, for instance, reflecting more incoming solar radiation back into space. Second, large-scale use of negative emission technologies (NETs) can remove previously emitted atmospheric CO2 and make an emission path partially reversible.  One type of NET is an air capture facility that directly removes CO2 from ambient air via chemical reactions (e.g., Stolaroff et al. 2008). These technologies are still under development and their cost is uncertain (Keith 2009). A second type of NET combines carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology with biomass-fired electricity generation (e.g., Rhodes and Keith 2005; Uddin and Barreto 2007). CCS is often discussed as a means of reducing the CO2 emissions from coal-fired power plants, but it can also be used to capture the CO2 that biomass previously absorbed from the atmosphere. In many modeling studies, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) makes low CO2 concentration targets possible by turning the energy sector into a net carbon sink (e.g., Fisher et al. 2007; Clarke et al. 2009; Azar et al. 2010; Edenhofer et al. 2010; van Vuuren et al. 2010b). We model climate policy portfolios with options to reduce emissions, to directly fund research and development (R&D) into low-carbon technologies, and to deploy NETs. The goal is to assess how the presence of different policy options affects optimal emission paths and policy costs. Most previous analyses of optimal policy portfolios have not included negative emission options (e.g., Fischer and Newell 2008; Gerlagh et al. 2009), and analyses that considered NETs did not embed them in a setting with R&D options. Among these, Keith et al. (2006) used an integrated assessment model to explore how possible air capture of CO2 affects climate strategies motivated by the possibility of abrupt climate change. They found that the future availability of air capture could reduce near-term abatement efforts but increase net long-term abatement, potentially returning atmospheric CO2 concentrations to preindustrial levels within 200 years. Azar et al. (2006) and Azar et al. (2010) found that bioenergy with carbon capture and storage can be quite valuable in enabling more ambitious CO2 targets (such as 350 ppm) but is less valuable if CO2 targets are closer to 450 ppm. Our model has less technological detail but more policy options, thereby providing insight into how NETs may influence climate policy portfolios. In addition to including NETs, we extend previous literature on the interaction between optimal abatement and R&D policies in the presence of endogenous technological change. Goulder and Mathai (2000) explored the implications of possible R&D investments and of learning-by-doing on optimal carbon taxes and abatement in both a cost-effectiveness and a benefit-cost setting.  Recognizing that both processes for producing technological change are important (Clarke et al. 2006), we include both channels in a cost-effectiveness setting: technological change can occur through public R&D policies, and technological change can also occur through the influence of abatement policies via learning-by-doing and private R&D.3 Because it is important to explicitly model uncertainty when evaluating the optimal strength of technology policy (Baker and Shittu 2008), we make technological change stochastic by adapting a three-point probability distribution (Baker and Adu-Bonnah 2008). Further, we model two types of technological progress: one that is more valuable at lower levels of abatement, and one that is more valuable at higher levels of abatement (Baker and Adu-Bonnah 2008). Technological change can therefore have two different types of impacts on abatement cost, and the realization of each type of technological change depends stochastically on both public R&D and abatement. We combine these technology policy options in a single stylized numerical model that also includes options to reduce emissions and to research and deploy NETs. We do not predict optimal policy paths but instead seek robust insights from a framework complex enough to have multiple interacting policy options. We explore how these policy options influence the portfolio that meets an exogenous CO2 constraint at the least expected cost. The CO2 constraint is fixed and known in a given model run, but technological change depends stochastically on previous abatement and R&D funding and policy choices can respond to observed technological change. We next describe the model for optimally selecting a climate policy portfolio in each of three periods over the 21st century. We then present the results of solving it with stochastic programming for several parameterizations and constraints. The results illustrate the implications of future negative emission options for optimal near-term abatement and R&D efforts and for the cost of policy portfolios. They also demonstrate how making policy avoid threshold effects from temporarily high CO2 levels affects the value and timing of NET deployment.",345.85056

We find that near-term abatement is not sensitive to the availability of R&D policies, but the anticipated availability of negative emission strategies can reduce the near-term abatement optimally undertaken to meet 2◦C temperature limits. Further, planning to deploy negative emission technologies shifts optimal R&D funding from “carbon-free” technologies into “emission intensity” technologies. Making negative emission strategies available enables an 80% reduction in the cost of keeping year 2100 CO2 concentrations near their current level. However, negative emission strategies are less important if the possibility of tipping points rules out using late-century net negative emissions to temporarily overshoot the CO2 constraint earlier in the century.",345.858845

While different power generation options will have direct climate outcomes, electricity prices to consumers will have strong economic impacts. It is important to note that POLES is a partial equilibrium model that uses an exogenous GDP forecast. As such, prices cannot influence the global economic evolution. Therefore, the prices shown in the following sections, especially the very high prices for some scenarios, should be considered with this in mind. As an example, we consider the evolution of power prices in the residential sector in non-OECD countries to see how the different configurations may impact the access to electricity in these countries. Power prices are forecast to increase during the next decades, with a steep rise during the next 15 years (Fig. 4). Indeed with a growing carbon taxation and a strongly emitting power mix (mostly relying on coal), non-OECD countries will be affected strongly. In the ‘All Technologies’ scenario, power prices in the constrained cases increase by approximately 50 % by 2100 compared to the baseline case. The absence ofnuclear exacerbates this trend, but it is broadly similar to the ‘all technologies’ scenario: a steeper increase in the mid-term due to rising carbon taxation and decreasing prices over the long-term as the power mix decarbonises. The ‘Without CCS’ scenario presents a very different forecast; power prices rise from 0.07 $/kWh in 2010 to 7–9 times that level in the constrained cases by 2100. Again, it should be noted that these prices are in the absence ofinnovative technologies to manage peak load power, either through energy storage from renewables or grid management to allow better integration of intermittent sources.  In the mid-term, prices remain within the World Bank’s (2008) estimate of willingness-to-pay for rural electrification (0.10–0.40 $/kWh), but as prices continue to rise connecting the world’s poor in rural areas may be increasingly unaffordable and residential electricity prices of this scale could be crippling for developing countries over the coming decades. While electricity prices on the scale of0.20–0.30 $/kWh are already observed in some OECD countries, those societies have already benefited from decades of access to much cheaper power. Many non-OECD countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, are struggling to provide basic power services to their citizens. Innovative solutions will need to be found for a global climate agreement limiting CO2e emissions that does not cripple non-OECD countries’ ability to develop their economies.",345.90171

However, a lack of non/low-emitting technologies in the investment portfolio drives up the marginal abatement cost required to satisfy a global GHG target and despite a technological analysis of the feasibility ofalternative options, an economic assessment is also necessary to understand the economic viability of these solutions (Table 1). In the ‘All Technologies’ case, to satisfy a carbon limit of550 ppm, the marginal abatement cost calculated by the POLES model reaches 260 $/tCO2e in 2100; to satisfy a 450 ppm target, the marginal cost is far higher even allowing for all technology choice.  Assuming a global nuclear phasing-out policy, the carbon price is comparable to the ‘all technologies’ case for both the 550 ppm and 450 ppm scenarios. Relatively minimal additional costs are incurred for the foregone baseload power since it is largely provided by fossil fuels with CCS, which have comparable total production costs to those of nuclear. The absence of CCS in the electricity portfolio appears much more critical in cost terms, even for a scenario with a 550 ppm CO2e limit. In 2050, the calculated carbon prices to be compatible with carbon objectives are 3–5 times higher than the ‘all technologies’ case. By 2100, the costs rise very steeply to impractical levels. The carbon price by the end of this scenario must be high enough to essentially remove all carbon from the power sector and is no longer really acting as a tax, but as a ban. CCS technology offers the particular advantage of negative emissions when trying to meet atmospheric CO2e concentration targets. When combined with biomass, CCS can effectively extract carbon from the atmosphere and sequester it underground. Considering that our global CO2e concentration has already reached 390 ppm CO2e in 2012, to achieve a 450 ppm goal, or even a 550 ppm target, the potential for negative emissions will be extremely useful. If this technology is unavailable because ofproblems with technological scale-up or difficulty finding appropriate storage locations, then negative emissions will likely be impossible.  A very high carbon price is therefore necessary to compensate for the loss of CCS while remaining within the CO2e target limits. Part of this high carbon price is due to the lack of available energy storage or grid management technologies, both in the POLES scenarios and at commercial scale in today’s industry. Over the very long term to 2100, innovations will certainly provide new options which could provide more flexibility, so the results included here should be viewed as an upper limit if given only today’s technologies. The carbon price multiplied by the necessary mitigation effort to reach a climate target (abatement cost) gives a sense of the economic burden that will be felt. As indicated in Fig. 3 below, abatement costs remain below 4 % of GDP for the ‘All Technologies’ and ‘Nuclear Phase Out’ cases, with dramatically higher costs associated to the ‘Without CCS’ case; CCS appears as a key technology to maintain abatement costs at a manageable level. This high cost is mainly related to a lack of guaranteed peak load generating choices if fossil fuel technologies are omitted from the energy mix; POLES must use very high carbon prices to drive renewables to displace fossil fuels as peak load options. Biomass-combustion technologies can only supply a small portion of this need given their limited potential. These results from the POLES model show that to some extent, nuclear and CCS act as substitutes for each other for reaching carbon constrained objectives. It is therefore very interesting to study the impact on costs of both technologies being unavailable (the electricity system relying much more strongly on renewables or energy efficiency measures). Compared to an ‘All Technologies’ case, turning offboth nuclear and CCS in the model leads to an abatement cost in 2100 of10.8 % of total world GDP to reach a 550 ppm concentration target (more than double the ‘Without CCS’ case). Electricity prices are unrealistically high by the end of the simulation causing up to 35 % reduction in total demand for electricity. Setting aside the extremely high prices, we can focus on the power mix which results from a combined nuclear phase-out and unavailability ofCCS. In 2100, renewables fill the gap through solar (increase of 23 % to 36 % oftotal electricity production), biomass (10 % to 22 %), hydro (6 % to 12 %), and hydrogen fuel cells (1.5 % to 8 %). As with the ‘Without CCS’ case, wind power is crowded out due to demand reduction and higher costs relative to the other technologies (wind’s share falls from 23 % in the ‘All Technologies’ case to 16 % in the no nuclear or CCS case). We were unable to adequately model the ‘Nuclear phase out and No CCS’ case for a 450 ppm concentration target. The extremely high costs associated with this scenario make results from POLES using a fixed GDP forecast unrealistic. Already in the ‘Without CCS’ case, total abatement costs are at 15 % of world GDP. When nuclear power is also unavailable, the abatement costs rise to impractical proportions of world GDP, and a true paradigm shift of the energy system that moves beyond supply and demand responses would be necessary in these circumstances (European Commission 2011). The POLES model, as well as most other energy–economy models, does not endogenously account for such a total change to the energy and material systems underpinning our economy.",346.00117

This situation could occur by country, as for Germany and Japan, or it could occur globally more generally. While it may be less likely that a global moratorium on new nuclear capacity will develop, we use the EMF27 ‘no nuclear’ scenarios to evaluate the maximum effect a global nuclear exit would have. In these scenarios, no new nuclear capacity is added and existing plants are retired according to their installation date and lifetimes. For the ‘Baseline with Nuclear Phase Out’ case, the complete exit from nuclear power is reached around 2060, with less than 10 % of the current capacity remaining in 2050. Without a price on carbon emissions, there is very little augmentation in the shares of electricity produced from wind and solar due to a progressive exit from nuclear power.  Globally, nuclear capacity stands at 380 GW in 2010 and generates approximately 13 % of electricity. In the baseline, nuclear capacity is 940 GW in 2050 and generates over 11 % of electricity, but as there is no price driver for low-emission technologies in the baseline fossil fuels fill almost this entire gap when nuclear is removed as a power option. In 2050, compared to the ‘with nuclear’ case wind capacity increases by 1.5 % of total energy, while solar does not increase its shares in a meaningful way. The ‘All Technologies’ scenarios have significant quantities of both nuclear and CCS generated electricity. 2 Shares of electricity production are similar in the 550 and 450 ppm baselines, in 2050: wind (17 %), solar (16 %), nuclear (18 %), CCS (44–45 %). When nuclear is removed, to replace its portion of total electricity production, primarily CCS, wind, and solar increase their shares as opposed to other generation technologies (Fig. 2). Most of the gap is filled by a rapid augmentation of CCS (especially fossil fuel-equipped CCS), which grows to supply an additional 11–13 % oftotal electricity (+4.7 to 5.7 GWh). Wind and solar production each grow modestly by 1–2 % (+0.4 to 0.9 GWh). CCS technology is not yet viable at the commercial scale and there are many cost and technical unknowns when considering a scale-up, but it offers great promise to help adapt our current fossil fuel based electricity system to a carbon price. To evaluate the complete unavailability of CCS for power generation, we use the EMF27 ‘no CCS’ scenario where carbon capture and storage never becomes a viable technology. To replace the very large portion of total electricity production supplied by CCS, nuclear and renewables generally fill the gap (Fig. 2). Nuclear in particular grows to supply an additional 26–30 % of total electricity production in 2050 (+10 to 14 GWh). Wind and solar production is relatively stable, remaining within ±5 %.3 By 2100, with the existing installed nuclear capacity and a 21 % reduction in electricity demand, wind power is generally “crowded out” from the production it provided in the ‘baseline’ case and actually decreasing from what it would have supplied without the carbon taxation.",346.00653

Hydropower is currently the principal renewable energy source, representing 85 % of total renewable production. While hydropower continues to expand slightly in absolute terms across most baseline scenarios, its share in total renewable electricity production decreases to around 20 % by the end of the outlook period (Fig. 1). Currently biomass plays a much less important role in the electricity generation than in final consuming sectors; however, its market share should remain stable to 2100 at the current 6 % of total renewable electricity. Wind and solar power deployment is becoming increasingly widespread, and their role becomes very prominent in some scenarios; for example, representing up to 53 % of total power generation by 2100 in the 450 Nuclear Phase Out scenario. Intermittent renewable electricity reaches around 37 % oftotal electricity generation in 2100 under the baseline ‘All Technologies’ scenario. In a scenario more favourable to renewable technologies (‘Baseline with Nuclear Phase Out’), the contributions of solar and wind are generally similar with a combined 39 % oftotal generation; most ofthe lost nuclear capacity is absorbed by fossil fuel technologies. Carbon pricing is therefore integral to the competitiveness of intermittent renewables. Both shares and production levels ofrenewable electricity are much higher in the presence of climate policies and their role increases continuously under carbon taxation. In ‘550 ppm All Technologies’, by 2100 the shares of generation for both wind and solar production increase by approximately 6–7 % compared to the Baseline case. Slightly stronger increases are found in the ‘450 ppm All Technologies’ scenario. A strong increase in the share of electricity generation from intermittent renewable sources may pose fundamental challenges to electricity systems. When the contribution of intermittent sources remains limited, the impacts of renewable energy policies on the average production cost and the electricity tariffs are also limited. This contributes to a good level of public acceptance that is generally observed for this type oftechnological solution. The large increase ofrenewables resulting from scenarios with strong climate policies brings concerns on how the cost of this solution and its associated backup facilities may affect electricity prices, and subsequently the competitiveness of large energy consumers or the energy budget of households. This has prompted studies and analyses on the impacts of an increasing amount of intermittent generation (Dale et al. 2004; Holttinen 2005). Some ofthe solutions that have been proposed are additional interconnections (Zvingilaite et al. 2008), more storage (Mariyappan et al. 2004; DeCarolis and Keith 2006), and demand response (Strbac 2008). A significant amount of intermittent generation will impact the way electricity systems operate, the electricity grid’s reliability, and the requirements for backup generation capacities or storage. Unless large integrated regional networks—or super-grids—are developed, it will be difficult to take advantage of the potential complementarities in the hourly production profiles of intermittent sources. In order to manage the irregularity of solar and wind energy production individual countries are normally forced to implement “backup” capacities, such as combined-cycle gas turbines (i.e. conventional means of electricity production), which are easily started, but can induce high levels of greenhouse gas emissions. Van der Welle and de Joode (2011) indicate that for the integration of intermittent technologies in power systems there is a wide range of different technical and institutional options available and propose some response options per segment of the electricity system. Examples include technical options in generation (e.g. large-scale energy storage), metering for demand response, and time-dependent pricing for networks and markets. Currently in the POLES model, capacity limits for intermittent technologies are simulated primarily through available backup capacities (thermal and hydropower). Electricity storage and integrated regional networks will be taken into account in upcoming model developments. The long term production cost of electricity is thus impacted by continuous changes in four main determinants: & shares of the different ower lant cate ories (intermittent renewables thermal nuclear and hydro) p pg ,, & investments costs b cate or accordin to technolo im rovement and learnin -b doing effects y g y, g gy p gy & avera e annual roduction costs b cate or includin chan es in capacity factors (especgially for bapckup options) y g y, gg & carbon cost for fossil thermal ower lants with or without CCS p p,",345.82129

In particular, Krey and Clarke (2011) compiled a synthesis covering 162 medium to long term scenarios from large-scale energy-economic and integrated assessment models, published during the 2006–2010 period. They argued that “there is little precision in the linkage between renewable global energy deployment and the stabilisation goal among the scenarios. This is not surprising given the uncertainty about the evolution of renewable energy technologies, the competitiveness of other options for reducing CO2 emissions and uncertainty drivers of energy demand”. They underline that scenario research on decarbonisation technologies could provide more information to unpack this uncertainty. Previous studies have included a nuclear phase-out, others constrained nuclear power to today’s levels, and still others limited nuclear power to its baseline levels, but these constraints on nuclear energy do not necessarily remove all nuclear power from the energy system. Due to the flexibility of installation and wide possible coverage of CCS and renewables technologies, a failure to apply them is likely to be very costly, especially in terms of investment needs in other power generation technologies (Tavoni et al. 2012). Our study aims to put upper bounds on the costs of removing one or both of nuclear and CCS from a decarbonisation strategy for the power sector by addressing a complete prohibition on the analysed technology. We consider that recent improvements in modelling of renewable technology performances in the POLES model and updated investment costs from the TECHPOL database provide a good opportunity to investigate the role of renewable energies within selected EMF27 climate mitigation scenarios, in terms of their share of power generation, carbon prices and abatement costs, and final user prices.",346.93422

The model provides technological change through dynamic processes such as the incorporation of two-factor learning curves, which combine the impacts of “learning by doing” and “learning by searching”. Price induced mechanisms drive technology diffusion under conditions of sectoral demand and inter-technology competition based on relative costs and merit orders, and allow for consideration ofkey drivers to future development of new energy technologies. The description of wind and solar power in POLES incorporates upper capacity limits based on land surfaces available for power production (average wind speed, annual solar irradiation, rooftop surfaces based on population). Renewables compete with other technologies to fill a “demand gap” created each year due to total generating stock retirement and electricity demand evolution. A significant amount of intermittent generation affects how electricity systems operate by: requiring more backup power, sometimes spilling electricity which cannot be used, extending the transmission system to accommodate new generation, or even reorganizing the electricity network in order to locally manage supply and demand (local smartgrids). Limits for wind and solar power development due to intermittency are included in POLES through the requirement ofexisting backup capacity (gas technologies or hydro) and are interpreted as a proxy for grid integration limits, institutional barriers, and energy storage constraints. Network and distributed power capacities are modelled separately to capture the different dynamics for investment. New developments will eventually be needed to better represent intermittency, such as a more detailed capacity credit and load factor, explicit link between intermittent generation and energy storage, and load curve alteration due to demand management. Total nuclear power is the net result of capacity additions from new plants and subtractions due to retirement of existing generating stock. Mid-term (next 5–15 years) capacity additions are calibrated to Enerdata’s Power Plant Tracker database, which follows announced, planned, and in-construction power plants. In the long-term, new nuclear additions compete with other technologies for market share. Nuclear capacity is removed from the system based on plant lifetimes and installation date. Carbon capture and storage technology offers the possibility to generate electricity from fossil fuels, but avoid emitting carbon to the atmosphere. In POLES, gas and coal electricity generation using CCS competes with conventional technologies when determining new generating capacity. For CCS, a premium is applied to the variable costs of conventional technologies to account for capture, transport, and sequestration costs; therefore, non-emitting fossil fuel technology will only appear in simulations that include a price for carbon emissions.",346.038986

With all of these factors playing a role in the carbon intensity of our future electricity system, can we afford to rely on renewables to cover a potential supply gap from significant nuclear phase-out around the world or the prospect of CCS technology arriving too late? Prior to the nuclear disaster at the Fukushima generating station, people were discussing a renaissance of nuclear energy as a clean, affordable, non-emitting power source (Joskow and Parsons 2012). However, with the most severe nuclear accident since Chernobyl bringing the potential safety hazards of nuclear power production to mind, several countries have decided to abandon or delay new facilities. Japan, Germany, and Switzerland have all officially confirmed or accelerated their plans for a nuclear exit since the Fukushima disaster. Other countries, such as the United States, are re-evaluating their existing and proposed projects in light of potentially more stringent safety regulations. This is also the case for developing countries such as China, South Korea, and India although their need for non-emitting electricity is much greater and could override concerns about potential safety risks (Buisson and Arsalane 2012). The contribution of CCS to future efforts to reduce climate change is uncertain. The technology holds immense promise to allow electricity generation to continue using fossil fuels, even under a carbon price, while reducing the power sector’s contribution to atmospheric GHG concentrations through avoided CO2e emissions (Finkenrath 2011). Yet despite the perceived technical benefits of CCS, demonstration projects continue to close after several years of operation, often citing uneconomic conditions or uncertain policy environments (AEP 2012; Pioneer Project 2012). If CCS is not available and society must transition quickly away from electricity generation using fossil fuels in order to meet climate targets, then the overall cost of transforming our power system could be much higher; for example, to reach the 2005 emission levels by 2050 could be up to 70 % greater without CCS according to the IEA (2010). Renewable electricity generation capacity is increasing rapidly around the world, both in OECD and developing countries, but wind and solar represented only 4 % of total capacity in 2010. As renewable energy technologies are still in the early stages of development, increases have been due mainly to aggressive adoption policies in a number of countries, such as Germany, China, and United Kingdom. Wind (onshore and offshore) and solar (photovoltaic or concentrating solar) are often cited as the main technologies when considering electricity generated from renewables. Alternatives like biomass can suffer from competition with food production, and energy demand may create perverse incentives in some countries (Mitchell 2008); this limit to potential surfaces for energy crops, as well as the competition for biofuel use, limits the available resources for power production in POLES. Renewables like large hydro and geothermal make considerable contributions in some countries, the prospects for expansion are relatively limited globally. Other possible renewable energy sources like tidal, wave, and small hydro are even earlier in the development cycle than wind and solar, and their potential for contributing to electricity generation in the next several decades is comparatively small.

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology has yet to become a commercially viable technology with little prospect of doing so without strong climate policy to spur development. The possibility ofusing renewable power generation from wind and solar as a non-emitting alternative to replace a nuclear phase-out or failure to deploy CCS technology is investigated using scenarios from EMF27 and the POLES model. A strong carbon price appears necessary to have significant penetration ofrenewables regardless of alternative generation technologies available, but especially if nuclear or CCS are absent from the energy supply system. The feasibility of replacing nuclear generation appears possible at realistic costs (evaluated as total abatement costs and final user prices to households); however for ambitious climate policies, such as a 450 ppm target, CCS could represent a critical technology that renewables will not be able to fully replace without unbearable economic costs.",346.85755

Scenarios with lower probabilities and comparably larger carbon budgets — from the >66% dominant in 2 °C scenarios to the >50% still prevalent in 1.5 °C scenarios (or, in IPCC jargon, from ‘likely’ to ‘more likely than not’) — seem unjustified, if not misleading; (2) the year 2100 should be retained as a date by which any temperature target has to be met, and hence by which any overshoot must end. If targets agreed upon in 2015 cannot be met by 2100 then it should be called failure; (3) climate scientists should provide clear constraints on magnitude and duration of overshoot, taking into account the geophysical impacts and the specific adaptation requirements of different overshoot profiles; (4) there should be an agreement to exclude any temperature overshoot scenario for 2 °C in future IPCC reports. This would be an easy way to communicate restrictions stemming from the Paris Agreement’s intention to strengthen the upper limit to ‘well below’ 2 °C; (5) and finally, requirements for net negative emissions after reaching the net zero line must be specified, scrutinized for feasibility  and should become an essential part of any science communication on ambitious mitigation pathways. These qualifications would strengthen the possibilities to evaluate contributions towards goal achievement politically and help hold governments accountable for insufficient action, even in the case of overshoot targets. Then — and only then — might the Paris Agreement’s global climate stabilization targets be able to steer ambitious mitigation action. ❐",344.84721

But rather than openly demanding such a lightened mitigation, climate diplomats would probably prefer to motivate scientists to change the relevant assumptions. Such a request could come in the guise of policymakers’ standard question under which circumstances it is still possible to achieve the politically agreed climate targets. Subsequently, policymakers tend to cherry-pick from the scientific answers. For example, although the community of integrated assessment modellers is highlighting that meeting the 1.5 °C target means reaching net zero emissions by 2050 at the latest, as well as massive amounts of carbon dioxide removal afterwards, almost every policymaker in favour of 1.5 °C talks only about ‘zero emissions by 2050’. The politically uncomfortable necessity of net negative emissions is usually omitted. To avoid such a scenario, climate scientists need to define constraints for overshoot. Otherwise, climate policymakers, and even more so other branches of governments, could easily miss the urgent need for drastic mitigation, because they are under the impression that even inadequate action will never result in political failure. establish standards Ensuring that mitigation targets — including overshoot pathways — are precise, evaluable and attainable, so that they can fulfill their intended function to regulate action towards goal achievement , is a task for all three Working Groups of the IPCC.

In the models between 600 and 3050 GtCO2 is captured cumulatively in this century. The share ofCCS-related technologies in primary energy use is also high under the 450 and 550 ppmv target looked at. The average ofall 42 model runs is 30 % in 2050 and 41 % in 2100. This level contrasts with the small amount of experiments with CCS at the moment. In most models CCS remains important across the century. While CCS is often mentioned as a bridging technology to advanced renewable energy systems, the models often consider CCS to be important until the end of the 21st century: here, the CO2 capture rates and the CCS share in primary energy use are higher in 2100 than in 2050 in the majority of the model runs. There is a large range of outcomes across the models. The projections ofCO2 captured cumulatively until 2100 by the different models diverges strongly. Even using the same target and some common technology assumptions for all models, the range of values (~600–3060 Gt in Low-Renewable-550) is comparable to the range of model averages that was found by the IPCC-TAR-scenario (133–3462 Gt) (IPCC 2005:356) under the same target, but different baselines. The large variation in results cannot easily be explained on the basis of individual model assumptions. Apparently, CCS use is a result of a complex interplay of several factors in each model. We have explored the possibility to explain the model results on the basis of known model characteristics and assumptions. In nearly all situations, it turned out not to be possible to easily explain model results on the basis of fuel costs, model types, and general or CCS-specific assumptions. These parameters are thus either not the driving forces, or their impact is confounded by other forces such that an external examination cannot identify their impact. Understanding the exact impact of different factors can therefore best be explored in a within-model sensitivity analysis. Assumed and current estimates of storage capacity do not pose a physical limit on the capture for any model on the global level, as long as aquifers are included. Using the whole range of storage options from the capacity estimates summarized in the literature, shows that there is enough storage potential until the end of the century (and for most models beyond 2100) even when pessimistic estimates are used. However, if we use the pessimistic estimates and exclude all potential for aquifers, storage potential estimates are not sufficient for the global CO2 captured until 2100 in about 65–75 % of the 42 model projections. Models indicate that under pessimistic technological development of renewable energies, CCS will play a larger role in the primary energy portfolio if one attempts to achieve similar climate targets. Scenario comparisons show that cumulative storage rates are often lower in the Low-Renewable-450 than in the Benchmark-Tech-450. Nevertheless, under the 550 ppmv target the majority of models capture more in the Low-Renewable case. Furthermore, the Low-Renewable cases mostly project higher CCS shares in primary energy use than the Benchmark-Tech cases. Under the 450 ppmv target CO2 captured is not necessarily higher than under the 550 ppmv target, but CCS shares in primary energy tend to be higher in the majority of models. The 2050 storage rates in the 450 scenarios are not always higher than in the 550 ppm scenarios. In the Low-Renewable case, only in half the models capture rates are higher under the 450 than under the 550 ppmv target. These results seem to be at odds with the model-average values reported from the IPCC-TAR-scenarios (IPCC 2005). Still, the shares of CCS in primary energy use generally increase in most models for the more stringent targets. Reasons for the seemingly counterintuitive projections of CCS deployment under low renewable assumptions or more stringent targets can mostly be explained by less absolute primary energy used for CCS, a fuel switch within CCS technologies (less CO2 is captured) as well as substitution between CCS and other energy sources (determines the share of CCS in primary energy use). BECCS use is especially attractive under stringent targets and no pessimistic restriction on biomass potentials. 90 % of the models substantially increase BECCS use in their CCS fuel portfolio substituting often for coal and, natural gas over time. When targets are less stringent and/or the biomass potentials are restricted in the scenario, the substitution over time is more heterogeneous between models. Further research to investigate impacts of CCS modeling parameters using within model studies is recommended. Although the sensitivity to some CCS parameters has been shown before (e.g. (Kurosawa 2004)), it was not possible to relate the variation in results to the CCS parameters in the cross-model comparison. Therefore, we recommend further research in within-model studies to investigate the impact of techno-economic uncertainty on the CCS deployment projections. This also implies that assumptions like costs and performance of technologies should be published with each study.",328.03307

This is likely an important reason for not being able to explain the CCS outcomes based on model characteristics although impacts seem logical. One key factor not included in our comparison is investment costs. Unfortunately, this data was not sufficiently available. Therefore, we focus on the LCOE of the cheapest CCS option versus the cheapest carbon-free-alternative for nine models of one scenario. Although capital costs usually make a large share in LCOE, no relationship with CO2 captured or CCS shares in primary energy use can be discovered. This indicates that capital costs might also not explain the variation in the cross-model comparison when isolated from other assumptions. Finally, the fact that we cannot identify a relationship between the model characteristics and the outcomes does not imply that higher detail of models is unnecessary. High detail is still necessary to address specific policy questions. As an example, the regionality of storage potential allows to evaluate the role of CCS on a regional level.",345.98963

In some scenarios the number of participating models is even smaller (for an overview ofthe amount ofparticipating models per scenario and models that could not find a solution see Krey et al. (2013)). Therefore, the sample size to derive solid conclusions for the CCS assumption analysis is small. Especially with respect to statistical assessments, conclusions should rather be seen as weak indicators, but not as proofs. Furthermore, many of the conclusions drawn with respect to the scenario comparison and development ofCCS should be interpreted as a tendency found in model results, since they are often based on the majority and average values ofresults. Hence, other outcomes are possible. Moreover, the conclusion that CCS is more important in model results than suggested by many papers and current investment rates needs to be taken with care. First of all, the model results focus on 2050, i.e. 40 years from now. Second, the models do not include many limitations that are important in reality, like social and political dynamics, or other market barriers (see also IPCC 2005:349,351). Still, the model results suggest that CCS is attractive also in the second half of the century. Also, we use the amount ofCO2 captured as an indication ofCCS deployment which is not a precise measure as natural gas and coal have different carbon contents. However, to summarize different sectors, CO2 capture is the most suitable indicator. To confirm results, we also often use the share of CCS in the use of primary energy. We showed that CCS might be deployed beyond the 21st century even under pessimistic capacity estimates with aquifers or the optimistic estimate without aquifers from IEA GHG (2011). However, we only compared the global amount of capacity. This does not take into account that the regional distribution of capacity might pose further limitations, i.e. reservoirs could be too far away for some relevant regions. Therefore, a regionally detailed model analysis of this limitation is necessary.",346.0288

This includes 1) fuel prices, 2) baseline emissions, 3) the type ofmodel, 4) modeling technology change, and 5) the way CCS is modeled. We test whether such factors—in isolation—can explain the range of model results. In summary, the results show no clear relationships between these factors and the projected CO2 captured ofthe models. (Section 4 of supplementary martial and Tables 13 and 14 explain and motivate the investigation in detail). The model results cannot be related to the type of model (Fig. 2). Results of the hybrid models, for example, can be found over the whole range of reported outcomes. Furthermore, Fig. 5 shows that a relationship between capture and the baseline emissions is not apparent from the current data set. Figure 3 shows the fuel shares in primary energy use with CCS for 2050 and 2100 along with the price change ofprimary energy (the price includes the carbon tax calculated based on the estimated carbon price in the models)7. A clear relationship between the fuel price increase/decrease and the substitution of shares is not always present for all fuels in all the scenarios and models. None of the model assumptions (Table 1) about the detail of CCS in the model, sectoral coverage, amount of sectors where BECCS is possible, power plant assumptions or implementation of technological development in the model can be related unambiguously to the amount of CO2 captured cumulatively by the models. Similarly, the model assumptions about CO2 transport and storage as summarized in Table 2 can also not be associated with the model outcomes. Also, no discernible relationship between the storage capacity assumption and the global CO2 stored can be derived (see also Fig. 1 in supplementary material). Finally, comparing the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE)8 for the cheapest CCS option divided by the cheapest carbon-free-alternative,  shows that the model with the lowest cost ratio does not have the highest capture rate, or share of CCS in electricity production and vice versa (See Fig. 2 in supplementary material). This implies that even the combined costs for (among others) fuel, operating and maintenance, transport and storage ofthe CCS power plant cannot explain the variation, when isolated from the remaining model assumptions.",345.994525

In the Benchmark-Tech-450, most of the models (9/10) substitute away from either coal, natural gas, or both, to higher biomass shares (14–56 %-point increase/ on average 28 %points). This fuel-switching towards biomass is less pronounced in combination with pessimistic assumptions about future renewable energy (average +12 %-points) - in particular bioenergy potentials - and for less stringent emissions mitigation targets (average +12 %points), or both (average -3 %-points). In the less pessimistic renewable case, the results come from the restriction on bioenergy potentials. For the less ambitious climate target, the result likely comes from the reduced importance of “negative emissions” from BECCS. Figure 4 shows the share of energy carriers in cumulative CCS electricity generation from 2010 until 2100. The preference ofCCS power plants for fuel types varies among the scenarios and models. In the Benchmark-Tech-450 scenario, BECCS has the largest share in the portfolio in 7 of 10 models, whereof five have more than 50 % and the highest is up to 70 %. In most models (5/6) this changes to natural gas if the scenarios assume low renewable availability (Low-Renewable-450), such that most often (6/8 models) natural gas dominates the cumulative fuel portfolio. Lowering the target (Benchmark-Tech-550) also leads to less dominance ofBECCS in CCS electricity. Instead, coal CCS is more often (6/12) dominating in both 550 scenarios.

In models of the first two groups, cumulative primary energy use decreases as a result of the increased carbon price. Consequently, cumulative primary energy used with CCS often decreases as well.  In models of group 1, the percentage decrease of total cumulative primary energy used is stronger than the reduction of cumulative CCS primary energy used. Therefore, CCS shares increase. In contrast, in models ofgroup 2, the cumulative fuel used with CCS decreases faster than the overall cumulative primary energy used and thus the shares of CCS decrease. Also cumulative CO2 capture decreases because the total amount of primary energy used with CCS decreases in most models of group one and two. Furthermore, it decreases in some models because the fuel mix used for CCS technologies changes to less carbon intensive fuels.

Four out often models show a difference less than ±1 Gt/yr, similarly for cumulative values).3 In the Low-Renewable scenarios, half of the models (4/8) project lower 2050-storage rates and lower cumulative CO2 capture in the 450 ppmv than in the 550 ppmv scenario (again, often small differences).

Again, often differences are small, but average values confirm this tendency. Finally, looking at CCS shares in cumulative primary energy provides a more insightful figure than cumulative CO2 capture values alone: CCS shares in cumulative primary energy use are somewhat higher for the stringent targets (8/10 and 6/8 models under Benchmark and Low-Renewable conditions, respectively). As one would expect, pessimistic assumptions about renewables usually lead to higher CCS shares in 2050 (8/8 and 12/12 models under 450 and 550 ppmv, respectively), and higher cumulative energy use (7/8 and 12/12 models under 450 and 550 ppmv, respectively). Again, the differences are often small.",346.01745

In fact, the cumulative capture in these models is at minimum about 600 and at maximum about 3000 GtCO2 until 2100. The scenario averages across the models are at least around 1160 in the Low-Renewable-450 and at most 1480 GtCO2 in the Low-Renewable-550 scenario. The shares of primary energy used with CCS demonstrate also the relative importance of CCS in the models. In 2050 they range from 9 to 53 % and in 2100 from 15 to 70 %. Across the 42 model runs the average shares are 30 % in 2050 and 41 % in 2100. In electricity production, the average shares are 37 % in 2050 and 34 % in 2100. Second, Fig. 1 also shows that the majority of the models in all four scenarios have higher storage rates in 2100 than in 2050 (Tables 8 and 9 in supplementary material). This is an interesting result because CCS is often mentioned as a “bridging technology” to “buy time” (Bauer 2006; Praetorius and Schumacher 2009; EU 2009). Apparently, CCS remains competitive throughout the 21st century. Obviously, in the longer time frame physical limits to storage imply that the technology will need to be substituted by other energy forms. Still, the role of CCS as a key contributor to energy supply during the 21st century instead of a bridging technology will possibly have consequences for technology pathways in various regions. A third observation is that there is clearly a wide divergence across models about the capture rate over time and total projected CO2 capture. For instance, by the end of the century, GRAPE projects the highest value ofabout 64 GtCO2/yr, while WITCH projects 12 GtCO2/yr in the Low-Renewable-550 (the overall range is 8–64 GtCO2/yr). Not surprisingly, the calculations of cumulative CO2 captured also differ widely, ranging from 625 (BET) to 2449 GtCO2 (IMACLIM) within the 450 ppmv scenarios. For the 550 ppmv target, the cumulative capture ranges from 613 (WITCH) to 3061 GtCO2 (GRAPE).",346.974095

(2013), Kriegler et al. (2013) and supplementary material of Kriegler et al. (2013). Assumptions about availability of nuclear and CCS, as well as energy intensity development are the same in the four scenarios. Benchmark-Tech scenarios further assume high technological progress of wind and solar as well as optimistic (but sustainable) biomass potentials. In contrast, the Low-Renewable cases assume conservative technological progress of renewables and limit bioenergy potentials to 100 EJ/yr. The carbon price in the four scenarios ranges between the models from 96 to 852 (Benchmnark-Tech-450), 174–2000 (Low-Renewable-450), 35–449 (Benchmark-Tech-550), and 85–550 (Low-Renewable-550) USD2005/tCO2 in 2050 and from 204 to 3348 (Benchmnark-Tech-450), 1898–20000 (Low-Renewable-450), 92–1188 (Benchmark-Tech-550), and 144–2369 (Low-Renewable-550) USD2005/tCO2 in 2100. We selected these scenarios: 1) As CCS is only used in mitigation scenarios, 2) to analyze the dependence of CCS deployment on the stringency of the climate target and 3) to look into competition with other low CO2 emitting options (in particular renewables). For each of these scenarios we look at the development of CO2 storage rates over time and the total variation of cumulative CO2 stored. Then, we compare the change in this amount and the share of CCS in cumulative primary energy used between scenarios. Furthermore, we compare projected cumulative storage until 2100 (and simple extrapolations beyond) to global potential estimates. Subsequently, we investigate the differences in fuels used with CCS between scenarios. Finally, we try to explore whether the variation in the model outcomes can be related to relevant general and CCS-specific assumptions or model types. For this, we compiled an overview of assumptions regarding the way CCS is modeled in the IAMs by consulting the modeling teams (Tables 1 and 2). Moreover, different model types may have tendencies to undervalue, or overvalue, for example, mitigation costs (IPCC 2005). We test this for the results of CO2 capture projections of these models. Consequently, we classified the models into three different groups on the basis of available model documentation (see supplementary material, Table 1): 1) technology-focus, 2) macro-economic-focus and 3) hybrid models, leaning on distinctions made by Löschel (2002) and Hourcade et al. (2006).",346.027478

The technology can be used to reduce emissions from power plants, hydrogen production, and industrial facilities and thus forms an alternative to renewables, nuclear power, and bio-energy (without CCS). The strength of CCS compared to some ofthese options is that relatively little system changes are required. Moreover, costs to reach different climate targets are often projected to be lower if CCS is part ofthe mitigation portfolio (Azar et al. 2006; IEA 2012; IPCC 2005). Furthermore, CCS can be very important to substantially reduce carbon emissions in some of the most CO2 intensive industries (steel, cement, etc.) (IEA 2012). Finally, bioenergy with CCS (BECCS) can create negative emissions, allowing to reach even ambitious climate goals (Azar et al. 2010). However, the technology is still surrounded by uncertainties and questions: 1) integrated CCS systems  are barely used on a large-scale (IEA 2012) such that costs and technical challenges are difficult to foresee (Flannery 2011). 2) Storage capacity estimates are uncertain and vary (Bradshaw et al. 2007; GEA 2012; IPCC 2005). 3) CCS may bear risks with respect to leakage (GEA 2012; IPCC 2005), 4) CCS is afflicted with various concerns from the public sphere (GEA 2012), and finally 5) in combination with fossil fuels, the energy system would still rely on non-renewable energy sources. Presumably related to some of these issues, CCS is often mentioned as a “bridging technology” to “buy time” (see e.g. (Bauer 2006; Praetorius and Schumacher 2009; EU 2009)) easing the transition to a renewable-based system (Bauer 2006; Praetorius and Schumacher 2009), while still reducing emissions. The future role of CCS in the energy system is uncertain. Deployment projections by integrated assessment models (IAMs) can be used to explore the future role of the technologies, based on different assumptions about technology development, climate policy and many other variables. Model comparison studies, like undertaken by the Energy Modeling Forum (EMF), have proven to be an effective tool to explore uncertainties of technologies and the implications for mitigation strategies in different models and to achieve a certain degree of robustness of conclusions (see overview EMF19 Weyant (2004)). So far relatively little explicit attention was paid to different CCS deployment strategies in such studies. A partial exception is the comparison of CCS deployment of the IPCC TAR-scenarios  as summarized in the IPCC (2005), but this study included only three models explicitly representing CCS and provided little detail. Still, from individual model studies ofthe EMF19 interesting conclusions regarding the importance, and uncertainty or sensitivity to techno-economic assumptions of CCS can be drawn (e.g. (Akimoto et al. 2004; Kurosawa 2004; Riahi et al. 2004; Smekens-Ramirez Morales 2004)). The model comparison study EMF27, a consortium of 18 IAMs, pays specific attention to the role of different technologies such as bio-energy and renewables in mitigation strategies (Rose et al. 2013; Luderer et al. 2013). Using the data from this EMF round, the present study is looking into the role of CCS. What role CCS can play, under which circumstances, and how this is influenced by model assumptions and type, is important to find out for policy makers and modelers. Using the EMF27 outcomes, in this paper we look into the following questions: What is the role of CCS in the different models in this century? How strong is the variation across the model results? Which influence do the mitigation target and the assumptions about renewables have? Is there enough storage capacity available? Which primary energy fuels are applied with CCS in the energy system over time and, in particular, in cumulative electricity production? How is this altered by the target and pessimistic assumptions for renewables? Finally, we try to relate the specific model outcomes to model assumptions and model type. The structure of the paper is organized around the questions formulated above.",345.977354

In this paper we analyze the results of different integrated assessment models (IAMs) taking part in the 27th round of the Energy Modeling Forum (EMF) with respect to the role of CCS in long term mitigation scenarios. Specifically we look into the use ofCCS as a function oftime, mitigation targets, availability ofrenewables and its use with different fuels. Furthermore, we explore the possibility to relate model results to general and CCS specific model assumptions. The results show a wide range ofcumulative capture in the 2010–2100 period (600–3050 GtCO2), but the fact that no model projects less than 600 GtCO2 indicates that CCS is considered to be important by all these models. Interestingly, CCS storage rates are often projected to be still increasing in the second halfofthis century. Depending on the scenario, at least six out ofeight, up to all models show higher storage rates in 2100 than in 2050. CCS shares in cumulative primary energy use are in most models increasing with the stringency of the target or under conservative availability of renewables. The strong variations of CCS deployment projection rates could not be related to the reported differences in the assumptions of the models by means of a cross-model comparison in this sample.",346.91563

GHGs differ in their warming influence on the global climate system due to their different radiative properties and lifetimes in the atmosphere. These warming influences may be expressed through a common metric based on the radiative forcing of CO2 (IPCC, 2007). power complements the power supply up to its maximum potential, assumed to be 25% of overall electricity generation by region. 13. In addition, the extent to which biomass can be produced on a large scale in a sustainable manner is also a concern.

At the highest level, the technology strategy articulated in all the scenarios in EMF27 includes three elements: decarbonize energy supply, increase the use oflowcarbon energy carriers in end-use, and reduce energy use. The way that the scenarios differ is in the degree to which these different elements of strategy are implemented, the timing of those implementations, and the associated macroeconomic costs. One robust element across scenarios is a relatively near-term decarbonization of electricity supply and a corresponding long-term increase in the use of electricity in end-use applications. There is far less agreement, however, about the appropriate mix oftechnologies for decarbonizing electricity, and this mix depends crucially on assumptions about supply technology characteristics and availability. What we might take away from this result is that there is more scope for choices in some elements of strategy based on other factors beyond simple economic costs (e.g., safety, waste, and proliferation concerns surrounding nuclear power or similar concerns about siting CO2 storage reservoirs). The scenarios are also largely consistent in demonstrating greater focus on reduction in energy intensity in the near-term than in the long-term. This behavior represents a natural progression in the role ofend-use sectors in climate mitigation. Energy reduction has higher value in the near-term because of the carbon intensity of key fuels, including electricity. In the long-term term, however, as electricity is decarbonized, fuel switching is relatively more valued. The two biggest defining assumptions for clustering energy pathways in the EMF27 scenarios are the ubiquity or availability of bioenergy and the ubiquity or availability of CCS, particularly for the 450 ppm scenarios. Even absent CCS, bioenergy is an important technology because its availability helps to define the transition in the transportation sector, which presents substantial challenges for fuel switching. Similarly, even without bioenergy CCS is a valuable technology because it allows a greater reliance on fossil fuels while moving to a low-carbon economy. However, the largest value may come from the combination of bioenergy and CCS, which creates an option for negative emissions. The implications of this option are profound, easing the capability to overshoot challenging targets in the transition phase and to compensate for residual fossil fuel emissions, reducing the challenge and lowering the costs of meeting those targets. Indeed, the presence or absence of negative emissions from BECCS has the largest influence among technology variations in this paper on the shape of the overshoot pathways toward stabilization in the 450 ppm scenarios.  It needs to be clearly stated though that significant overshoot changes the nature ofthe climate target by reducing the likelihood of staying below a given temperature threshold considerably compared to a pathway that reaches the same long-term concentration target without overshoot. At the same time, it is important not to oversimplify the relevance of these single technologies, because the stringency ofa 450 ppm CO2e goal leads to different conclusions than a 550 ppm target. The effects oftechnology availability were both smaller and more even in the 550 ppm than in the 450 ppm CO2e scenarios, and only three models were not able to produce any single 550 ppm scenario. In other words, the EMF27 scenarios tell us that there are many options for meeting the level ofreductions required in a 550 ppm CO2e goal, and it is not absolutely critical to have all the arrows in the quiver; but there is a step change in the magnitude ofthe challenge, and hence in the importance of a full technology portfolio, when moving to a 450 ppm CO2e scenario.",346.997886

Mitigation costs generally vary quite significantly between models (Fig. 5b, Figure S4.3a in SM for 550 ppm), leading to significant overlaps of the ranges of cost increases in the technology sensitivity cases (Fisher et al. 2007). To reduce this model bias in mitigation costs, it is instructive to consider the change in costs relative to a benchmark case. For this purpose, we use the 450 FullTech scenario (Fig. 5c, Figure S4.3b for 550 ppm). It is important to note, however, that this approach does not fully ameliorate the variation in cost effects of different technologies portfolios. To test the robustness of the insights presented, Figures S4.4 provides cost calculations with other discount rates and for specific points in time which qualitatively support the same findings. Another challenge in interpreting cost results arises from the fact that not all scenarios can be produced by all models. This leads to a downward bias in the cost reporting (Tavoni and Tol 2010). In general, the ranges for any of the scenarios that were not produced by all models should be considered to be higher, and perhaps much higher, than those shown in Fig. 5 and Figure S4.3 (see also feasibility indicator at the bottom of the figure panels). In addition to this representation bias, it should be noted that some models do not represent some technologies (e.g., BECCS) in the first place and therefore also do not show a strong reaction in policy costs if related options (e.g., CCS, bioenergy) are restricted (Section 2.2, Table S2.1, Figure S4.5). In several ways, the cost sensitivity results mirror those associated with the ability of models to meet particular targets discussed in Section 4.2. A first observation is that the sensitivity of mitigation costs to technology availability significantly increases with increasing target stringency (Fig. 5 and Figure S4.3). This illustrates that broad technology portfolios become more important for reaching more ambitious climate targets, just as was indicated from the results in Section 4.2. The second observation in this regard is that the unavailability of CCS leads to the strongest increase in mitigation costs for any single technology variation for both the 450 ppm (Fig. 5) and the 550 ppm target (Figure S4.3). This result is robust even considering the bias in scenario reporting for the scenarios without CCS. The cost increases associated with limited bioenergy are similar to those for limited CCS. CCS and bioenergy actually share two characteristics that can help motivating the similarity in the cost increase under the 450 ppm target, i.e. the generation of negative emissions and their applicability outside of the electric sector (cf. Section 3). In contrast, constraining the three alternative electricity generation options – nuclear power, wind and solar – leads only to a modest increase of mitigation costs of below 20 % for most models in the 450 ppm scenario. This finding originates from the existence of numerous alternatives for generating electricity from low-carbon sources and that these technologies have a large degree of substitutability. More broadly, and not surprisingly, combined limits on technology generally lead to costs at the higher end of the cost ranges shown in Fig. 5. The scenarios with reduced energy demand provide some complexities in their interpretation. On the one hand, lower energy demand reduces the costs ofmitigation substantially across models as shown by the LowEI case. This benefit perhaps offsets some of the potential cost increases in the EERE scenarios. On the other hand, the benefits of the energy demand reduction do not come with a price tag in this study, essentially assuming autonomous energy intensity improvements at rates that are twice the observed ones over the past 40 years.",346.9362

The capability of models to produce 550 ppm CO2e scenarios is only mildly affected by the variation of technology availability, cost and performance with very few models indicating difficulties of achieving the target under constrained technology availability. In contrast, a substantial number of models were not able to produce 450 ppm scenarios without CCS. Indeed, the vast majority of situations in which models could not produce scenarios were those in which CCS was assumed to be unavailable. In contrast, a phase-out ofnuclear power or pessimistic assumptions about wind and solar power do not have a comparable effect because of numerous competing low-carbon supply options in electricity generation. The importance of CCS can be attributed to the fact that CCS serves several different purposes, the most relevant of which is the capability of sequestering carbon from the atmosphere when applied jointly with bioenergy (Tavoni and Socolow 2013). In addition, unlike other technologies assessed in this study, it is a very versatile technology that has the potential to contribute to decarbonization via different processes, such as electricity generation and synthetic fuel production from different feedstock and in industry. Finally, none of the long-term models found it viable to produce a scenario in which all low-carbon supply technologies are constrained. This finding shows the crucial role of technology for decarbonization and therefore reaching ambitious climate targets. It also emphasizes that energy efficiency and demand-side measures alone are insufficient for climate stabilization (cf. Section 3.1).",346.933387

Ultimately, judgments about feasibility are based on subjective assessments ofwhether deployment levels could be achieved, societies would be willing to bear the associated costs, or other social, political, physical, or institutional factors might impinge on the ability to meet a particular goal. Nonetheless, among the pieces ofevidence for assessing the challenge ofmeeting particular goals is the degree to which models are even capable of producing scenarios to meet such goals. If scenarios reaching particular climate goals cannot even be produced by models under particular assumptions about technology, it provides some evidence that meeting the goal under those circumstances would be challenging (Fig. 5a, see also SM Section 4.2).",346.03897

In the context of the EMF27 scenarios, this effect is largely a function oftwo factors: the ability to overshoot the long-term stabilization goal and the presence of options for negative emissions. For the purpose of this paper, the latter can mostly be interpreted as the use ofBECCS (although there are other options like afforestation that can generate a net negative carbon flux). There is a significant impact on the timing ofmitigation under the 450 ppm target ifCCS is not available or ifbioenergy potential is limited (Fig. 3). The potential for negative emissions is greatly reduced under these technology variations, which requires more substantial near-term emissions reductions (cf. Tavoni and Socolow (2013)). However, it is worthwhile noting that both CCS and bioenergy have a role to play in mitigation that goes beyond the potential of generating negative emissions. All other technology variations result in no significant changes in the CO2 emissions trajectory (Figure S4.1). Different sectors have different roles in climate mitigation which can be analyzed by looking at the development of direct emissions from sectors over time. Reductions in direct emissions are the result of decreases in energy demand or production and switching to lower carbon fuels. Across the different sectors of the energy system, decarbonization happens at different speeds and to different extend (Fig. 4a). Direct CO2 emissions of electricity generation decline fastest and reach close to zero by 2050 in all 450 FullTech scenarios, eventually going negative for models representing the option of BECCS. The industry and buildings sectors reduce their direct emissions at similar speed and extent. In contrast, the transport sector exhibits the slowest decarbonization rate, supporting the general notion that emissions reductions in transport are most costly. The variation in the decarbonization of the transport sector can be related to some degree to fuel switching to electricity and hydrogen (Figure S4.2, Table S4.1). Also non-CO2 emissions, mostly CH4 and N2O from agricultural sources, are harder to mitigate and stay at a level comparable to today even in the 450 ppm scenarios. The reason for the different timing and extent of decarbonization across sectors are primarily the availability of options and their costs (cf. Sections 3.3/3.4). If CCS is unavailable, emissions in the electricity sector converge to zero, but cannot go negative, thereby forcing the end-use sectors to reduce their direct emissions more rapidly. This effect occurs to a lesser degree for the limitation of bioenergy supply as it effectively constrains the amount of BECCS deployment. The increased emissions reductions requirement puts a particular strain on sectors where the proportion of non-electric energy use is large. Since, as discussed above, CCS and bioenergy are the main options to decarbonize non-electric energy use, the constraints on CCS or bioenergy impose a double burden. Not only do they increase the need to abate sector emissions due to constraining negative emissions deployment, they also limit the ability to enact this abatement. As a result, end-use sectors such as transportation and industry respond with a much stronger decrease of energy use and an increased rate of electrification and/or adoption of hydrogen technologies, pushing up costs. Further, the assumptions about emissions from land-use have a marked implication on the timing and extent of decarbonization in the energy sectors with some models that include land-based carbon sinks generating some extra headroom for the energy sector emissions.",346.019956

In part this shift can be attributed to prices of electricity increasing more slowly than prices of other fuels. The degree to which solid fuels are phased out and the degree of electrification both vary considerably in total as well as across the end-use sectors (Fig. 2c-e, S3.1c-e). A robust dynamic across mitigation scenarios is increased electrification (Fig. 2c-e, Figure S3.3). Due to ample availability of advanced low-carbon technologies, electricity supply can be decarbonized at relatively modest extra costs (cf. Section 4.3). As discussed, many options for replacing fossil fuels in non-electric energy supply have limited potential or are more costly. As a consequence prices for non-electric energy carriers tend to increase much more significantly than the price of electricity in mitigation scenarios. Therefore, climate policies strongly accelerate the electrification trend present in the baseline scenarios. In particular residential and commercial buildings are electrified up to 95 % under the 450 ppm target (Figure S3.1c), a trend which is less pronounced in industry where in specific applications carbonaceous fuels are costly to substitute (e.g., primary steel making). In transportation, the highest electrification rates exceed 30 % (Figure S3.1e). Where included, hydrogen can take a similar role as electricity, thereby achieving substantial shares of final energy, in particular in transport and to a lesser extent in industry.",346.935186

However, it is important to bear in mind that non-electric energy carriers currently account for more than three quarters of global final energy and more than 60 % of global energy-related CO2 emissions at present. Further, many of the key questions about feasibility and costs of mitigation involve the options for mitigation in non-electric energy conversion and use. The starting point for these mitigation actions is a non-electric sector without climate policy dominated by fossil fuels, based on the ease with which fossil resources can be transformed to liquid, gaseous and solid fuels. The transformation ofnon-electric energy under mitigation stands in sharp contrast to that of the electric sector. Whereas in the electric sector mitigation leads to an ambiguous change in production levels (see previous section), non-electric energy is unambiguously reduced relative to the baseline scenarios in all models, and the mix maintains substantial fossil energy. Biomass is the most important low-carbon alternative for non-electric energy supply in the EMF27 scenarios, so its cost, performance, and availability have the largest influence on the transformation of non-electric energy under carbon mitigation. Biomass can substitute fossil fuels in most non-electric applications, most notably in the transport sector where few other technologies are represented in most models. Some models include hydrogen produced from carbon-free sources or from fossils in combination with CCS (Table S2.1), others include solar thermal and geothermal systems to supply heat. More broadly speaking, scenarios from models with higher technological detail generally show that these other options can make a significant contribution to emission reductions, but are insufficient to reduce the reliance on fossil fuels and biomass substantially because they are largely confined to stationary applications (solar, geothermal heat) or require building up new and costly infrastructure to substitute transport fuels (e.g., hydrogen).",345.930734

In the baseline scenarios, electricity production remains heavily reliant on fossil fuels (Figure S4.2d). Although coal dominates power supply in most baseline scenarios (see Section 3.2), some models project an increasing share ofgas. There is less agreement about the penetration ofnon-fossil power supply. The share ofnuclear power, for example, is decreasing over time in some models (Kim et al. this issue). Renewables are scaled up in the long-term even in absence ofclimate policies in most models. While the increase ofthe RE share is rather gradual in most scenarios, some models show strong increases ofRE deployment absent climate policy in the 2nd halfofthe century, resulting in RE shares in excess of60 % ofglobal electricity production by 2100 (cf. Luderer et al. (2013)). These developments are driven by a number of factors, including resource availability (Kim et al. this issue; McCollum et al. 2013), energy trade, the technological change assumptions for the power sector technologies as well as systems integration (Luderer et al. 2013) and the decision making mechanism employed by the models (Kriegler et al. 2013), all of which influence the competitiveness of power generation options. All models in this study represent multiple technologies for decarbonizing electricity supply, including nuclear power, CCS, and renewables (Table S2.1). As a consequence, in the 450 ppm mitigation scenarios by 2050 only a small share ofpower supply comes from freely emitting fossil installations (Figure S3.2f). In particular, coal power generation without CCS is phased out most rapidly due to its high emission intensity. Although all models agree in showing a rapid and almost full-scale decarbonization of electricity supply, they also show that there are a variety of possible low-carbon configurations of the electricity sector (Figure S3.2) which are primarily driven by different assumptions about future technological development. In addition, models do not agree about the response in total electricity generation. About halfthe models that run to 2100 show higher average annual electricity generation under the 450 ppm target compared to the baseline while the other halfreduces generation, in some cases significantly. In the first group ofmodels, electricity is decarbonized pervasively at relatively moderate costs and electrification of end-use sectors (e.g., transport) is increased substantially. In the second group of models the demand reduction effect is stronger than the electrification effect in end-use, leading to a reduction in total electricity generation.",345.999295

Without policies constraining GHG emissions, fossil fuels continue to dominate energy supply (Fig. 2a, Figure S3.2a); that is, under baseline assumptions adopted by modelers, the energy system does not decarbonize without climate policy. Among fossil fuels, scenarios consistently project a decrease of the combined share of hydrocarbons and an increase in the share of coal. This renaissance in coal largely reflects differences in resource availability and extraction costs: recent increases in gas reserves notwithstanding, coal is generally perceived as far more abundant and cheaper than gas and oil (McCollum et al. 2013). The climate mitigation scenarios place a tight limit on the use offreely emitting fossil energy, lower than in any ofthe reference scenarios. In the 450 FullTech scenario, cumulative TPES from 2010 to 2100 is 15 to 45 % lower than in the baseline (Figure S3.2c). Cumulative fossil fuel use decreases by at least 35 % compared to baseline levels in most 550 ppm, and by more than 50 % in most 450 ppm scenarios. The decline is most pronounced for coal because of its relatively higher carbon content. A substantial share of the remaining coal and gas is used in combination with CCS. Some models maintain a considerable share ofcoal with CCS in the primary energy mix, particularly in the 550 ppm scenario, while others rely more strongly on non-fossil alternatives. Two factors that are particularly relevant for the role of CCS in stringent mitigation scenarios are the assumed capture rates and the degree to which supply chain GHG emissions (e.g., methane emissions from coal mining) are represented and can be avoided.",345.96423

There is generally quite a large spread across models regarding the combination of these two mechanisms to reach a specific climate target (Fig. 1). In the medium to long-term overall carbon intensity reduction plays the dominant role compared to energy intensity reduction. However, the timing of these two mechanisms is significantly different with most of the energy intensity improvements relative to baseline performed in the short- to medium-term (2020/2030) when the energy supply system is still carbon intensive (Sugiyama et al., Submitted for publication in this special issue) whereas the build-up of new infrastructure that is necessary for significant carbon intensity reductions takes more time, but dominates after 2030 (Fig. 1, cf.

All of these have multiple dimensions, and they cannot be discussed in detail in this paper. Here we focus on two areas of model characteristics that vary noticeably across models and that are relevant for understanding the energy system transformations in EMF27. The first is the representation ofthe energy system. These structural assumptions can interact strongly with the variation of technology availability, costs and performance in the study design. Some differences in representation are readily apparent. For example, models with limited coverage of biofuels will be affected by bioenergy constraints to a lesser extent than those with extensive coverage and may have difficulties in achieving ambitious targets regard-less (see Figure S4.6 in the supplementary material (SM)). However, some are far more embedded in the details of the model, such as the relative costs of technologies, constraints on their expansion, limits on deployment of renewables (RE) in electricity generation and so forth (Clarke et al. 2012; Kim et al. this issue; Kriegler et al. 2013). All these interact and influence results in important ways. Among the most apparent elements ofthe system representation is simply which technologies are included in models and which are not (see Table S2.1 in SM). The coverage of technology options is quite similar in the electricity sector. Only the representation of producing electricity from concentrating solar power (CSP), geothermal energy and biomass in combination with CCS varies noticeably across models. Almost all other options listed in Table S2.1 are represented in all models. Of particular note, the coverage of bioenergy with CCS (BECCS) has increased compared to earlier reviews (Krey and Clarke 2011). As will be discussed later, this technology combination has proven particularly important. In contrast, there is far more heterogeneity in the liquids sector. The representation of coal- and gas-based synthetic fuels varies considerably (particularly in combination with CCS) whereas most models include the option of producing liquid biofuels. Hydrogen and synthetic gas production are explicitly represented in a minority ofmodels, and, again, even less so in combination with CCS. It is important to note that not all models represent all energy carriers explicitly, but capture these implicitly in more general terms, e.g. in an aggregate non-electric sector. Another important difference between models that influences energy system transformations is that CO2 emissions budgets for the energy system differ noticeably across models (see Kriegler et al. (2013)). The two primary reasons are (i) differences in the total anthropogenic CO2 emissions budget based on differences in carbon cycle treatments and the contributions of non-CO2 substances, and (ii) differences in the allocation of CO2 emissions between the energy system and other sectors, most notably from land-use (e.g. afforestation). These differences in energy CO2 budgets are important because they imply that identical stabilization goals will lead to different levels ofoverall energy system transformation in different models, notjust in the way the transformations are achieved (Blanford et al. 2013).",346.98913

An important difference between the two stabilization goals is that the 550 ppm target does not allow to overshoot this level ofCO2e concentrations at any time until 2100 whereas in the 450 ppm case a temporary overshoot is allowed as long as CO2e concentrations return to 450 ppm by 2100.

Both topics have been explored to various degrees in previous literature. Characterizing energy system transformations for stabilizing GHG concentrations has seen the most extensive treatment with most integrated assessment modeling papers over the last several decades providing at least some information on energy system transformations. And several recent multi-model intercomparisons have focused on this issue (Clarke et al. 2008, 2012). The influence oftechnology on mitigations costs and feasibility ofambitious climate targets has also been explored in a number of individual model studies (e.g., Kim et al. (2000), Riahi et al. (2012)) as well as several smaller model intercomparisons (Edenhofer et al. 2010; Luderer et al. 2012), all of which have shown the profound implications of technology availability for the transformation of the energy system under different climate targets. Although the role of technology in climate mitigation along these dimensions has been explored to various degrees in previous studies, there exists no single study that systematically explores the role of technology across a wide suite of models using a coordinated set of technology assumptions.

The combination of the large number of models and the coordinated technology assumptions in EMF27 provide an unprecedented opportunity to systematically test the robustness of insights about the role oftechnology based on model analyses. The paper provides a characterization ofthe transformations in the EMF27 scenarios by analyzing adjustments throughout the conversion chain from primary to secondary to final energy.

The study also discusses the value of individual technologies for achieving climate stabilization. A robust finding is that the unavailability of carbon capture and storage and limited availability of bioenergy have the largest impact on feasibility and macroeconomic costs for stabilizing atmospheric concentrations at low levels, mostly because of their combined ability to remove carbon from the atmosphere.

Population and economic growth rates influence the scale of African’s economy, and its future energy use and emissions. However, our analysis shows that affluence levels are only one face of the medal, and the range of future emissions is only partly explained by the different economic trends. We show that technological factors could also be important. In a medium economic and population growth scenario (BAU DEF), the share ofglobal CO2 emissions ofContinental Africa is approximately 20 % in 2100 in both GCAM and IPAC. The range for Sub-Saharan Africa is between 4.0 % and 9.8 %. This variation indicates that African growth can be fueled by very different energy mixes and economic structures. A common finding across models is that in the absence of climate policy, the demand for fossil energy increases over time with economic growth to meet the growing energy needs and to replace the use of traditional bioenergy. Instead, should the growth of average per capita income remain low (as in the BAU HI Pop case), a large fraction of the population could continue to rely on traditional biomass. Regarding what the scenarios might imply for achieving some development-related energy goals, our analysis suggests that the share of electricity in final energy, electric capacity, and electricity use per capita all rise, while the traditional biomass share declines with growing affluence. Yet, the average levels offinal energy and electricity use projected by the models across the different scenarios, even under fast economic growth (BAU FS Gr), could fail to ensure a minimum threshold use for everyone. Climate policy could result in more rapid electric capacity growth if carbon-free sources become competitive, but lower average electricity use in the short-run. The models cannot really inform us of whether the higher electricity capacity enables greater access for the entire population. Despite the fundamental role ofeconomic growth in increasing energy access and some potential co-benefits with climate policy, it is likely that dedicated policies that enhance equity across the region will be needed. The analysis carried out here makes an important contribution to the scenarios literature by focusing on a region that has been rather underexplored to date. Since Africa starts from a low base, both in terms of per capita income and per capita energy use, its potential future development is uncertain. Which development pathway Africa follows will influence its emissions and could potentially impact global emissions due to the projected size of Africa’s economy and population. At the same time, this analysis raises issues for further research and investigation. A more explicit incorporation of efficiencies of end-use technologies in future analysis and model development would strengthen links between macroeconomic growth trends and energy service demands, which are what ultimately link to development. In addition, further comparative analysis across regions, would allow for a better under-standing of the drivers of energy demand in the region and for assessing similarities and differences in patterns of change from other developing regions. Furthermore, this research does not address institutional and financial issues, and such additions could be explored in future work. Finally, a more refined analysis of the development and welfare impacts of differing socio-economic and energy futures in the region will require future model-based scenario analysis to incorporate greater heterogeneity and disaggregation that captures differences across population sub-groups and end-use sub-sectors.",345.978394

However, among poor households, reliance on solid fuels (e.g. traditional biomass), self-collected and burnt in inefficient devices is extremely high (Pachauri et al. 2012). With growing affluence and urbanization, a transition to using more efficient liquid, gaseous and grid carriers has been observed in other nations (Pachauri and Jiang 2008). Such a transition has positive developmental benefits as it reduces drudgery and health impacts for households associated with solid fuel use. Only one of the models participating in the RoSE project includes a breakdown of residential sector final energy use by type of energy. According to the GCAM projections, a clear transition away from traditional biomass use towards more efficient liquid, gaseous and grid sources of energy results in a decline in per capita final energy use between 2005 and 2030 (Figure 4 in SM). While not much variation in the total final residential energy use per capita is observed across the three medium population scenarios, there is a faster increase in the use of more convenient grid sources under the BAU FS Gr Scenario. Under the BAU HI Pop Scenario, the total final residential energy use per capita in 2050 is lower and the share of traditional biomass is significantly higher as compared to that in the other scenarios. Further, under climate policy, the transition away from traditional biomass is much slower. As most ofresidential energy use in the region is used for cooking or lighting, applying some simplifying assumptions, allows us to estimate the likely continued reliance on traditional solid fuels for cooking. Assuming that no electricity and only halfofliquid fuels are used for thermal purposes, and applying standard efficiencies of conversion in end-use devices (Ekholm et al. 2010), we project that in 2050, under the BAU SL Gr, BAU DEF and BAU FS Gr Scenarios, about 30 % of total cooking energy needs may still be met from solid fuels, whereas under the BAU HI Pop Scenario, about half of cooking energy needs may still be met using solid fuels. Under the climate scenarios, this share is projected to remain closer to two-thirds in 2030. This continued reliance on solid fuels for cooking in the region will have associated with it adverse health and welfare costs for its population unless widespread dissemination and use ofadvanced biomass cookstoves, that have performance characteristics similar to gas stoves, is encouraged.",346.877517

For this reason, access to electricity is considered an important indicator of modernization and development. Sub-Saharan Africa suffers acutely from a lack of access to electricity and poor quality ofsupply, where it does exist (Bazilian et al. 2012). Only a third of the region’s population is electrified even today (IEA 2012). Excluding South Africa, the entire installed generation capacity of Sub-Saharan Africa is about 40 GW, less than that in Mexico alone (EIA 2013b). Thus, a growth in installed capacity and electricity generation is critical to power development in the region (Eberhard et al. 2011). Pachauri et al. (2013) estimate that an additional 20 GW of installed capacity by 2030 would be required to provide basic electricity access to all households in Sub-Saharan Africa (420 kWh/year/household to meet basic lighting and minor appliance use). Bazilian et al. (2012) estimate that providing everyone in Sub-Saharan Africa (excluding South Africa) with moderate access (both for direct residential purposes and economy-wide productive uses) would require an installed generation capacity ofabout 374GW or an annual growth rate in capacity of13 % for the next 20 years. Even under the BAU FS Gr Scenarios, the models do not predict an average growth of 13 % per year in installed capacity. Further, electricity use per capita under all scenarios in Sub-Saharan Africa is projected to stay below 1500 kWh/capita till the middle of the century (equivalent to the average use in North Africa today) (Fig. 6c, d). With imposition of climate policies, larger electric capacity is added in REMIND and IPAC compared to the baseline scenarios with greater deployment ofcarbon-free solar and nuclear technologies, but the models project lower average electricity use. Whether more rapid electricity capacity growth results in higher connectivity for the entire population will rest ultimately on the effectiveness of policies that enhance equity in access to and use of electricity on the sub-continent, something the models are unable to capture as yet.",346.99116

More recently estimates in the range of 50–70 GJ/capita have been suggested as necessary to provide for basic human development (Nilsson et al. 2012; Smil 2003). Even if such a threshold exists, recent research suggests that this level may not be constant. Some decoupling with economic growth is expected over time, and the threshold may vary significantly across nations depending on which aspects ofhuman development are considered (Steinberger and Roberts 2010). However, the exact welfare impacts ofchanges in average final energy use depend ultimately on how this use is distributed across a population. Across most models and all scenarios, average final energy use is projected to remain below 50 GJ/capita till 2050, far below the average in most OECD countries today (Fig. 3). This level may not be inconsistent with achieving developmental objectives on the continent. However, achieving these goals is likely to be more challenging under the BAU HI Pop Scenario and the climate policy scenarios (SM Figure 2), since average final energy use in these cases is projected to be lower across all models. In order to explore what the scenario projections might imply for the numbers of Africans that could remain below a threshold level of final energy use in 2030, we carry out a thought experiment based on an ex-post distributional assumption. We assume the income distribution in Sub-Saharan Africa follows the trend assumed by the Global Energy Assessment-Mix (GEA-M) scenario (Riahi et al. 2012). Further, we assume that final energy distribution mirrors this income distribution (see (Chakravarty and Tavoni 2013) for recent research that follows this approach). All the scenarios and models project a rise in average final energy use over time. However, under these distributional assumptions, 11 %–27 % ofsub-Saharan Africans in 2030, and even as many as 12 % by 2050 could have an average use that is below a threshold that meets even basic direct residential energy needs , unless dedicated policies that enhance equity are implemented.",346.94362

For instance, in the case of the USA, biomass intensity in the economy was seen to decline exponentially with economic growth. Its share in primary energy dropped to under a third by the early 1900s, once average incomes reached about $5000/capita (Victor and Victor 2002). As traditional biomass use has adverse implications for human health and welfare, and is extremely inefficient (Pachauri et al. 2013), a transition away from it is desirable from a developmental perspective. This is indeed a common feature of all scenarios and models examined in this paper. Over time the share of traditional biomass declines. In 2005, biomass is the predominant energy source in all models, with a share varying from 80 % in REMIND and WITCH for Sub-Saharan Africa, to 30–40 % in GCAM and IPAC for the entire continent. Across all the models and scenarios, the share of primary biomass is projected to fall to below a third when income reaches a level of between $3600/capita and $4200/capita (approximately $10/capita/day and above) (Fig. 6a, b). However, for the BAU HI Pop Scenario, average income is projected to stay below $5000/capita till 2040 and the share of primary biomass correspondingly high (even as high as 44 % for Sub-Saharan Africa, according to the WITCH model). Imposing a climate policy, results in an even slower transition away from traditional biomass. This persistently high level of biomass intensity in the region, suggests that a large share of the population could continue to rely primarily on biomass to meet its residential needs for the next couple of decades.",345.96882

The imposition of such a policy forces significant abatement in Africa (Fig. 4a, b). At least 70 % of emissions must be abated by the end of the century in all models and scenarios. Some models show more than 100 % emissions reductions in a given year, indicating a heavy reliance on bioenergy in combination with CO2 capture and storage (BECCS). We use the Kaya Identity to isolate the contribution ofreductions in energy use and ofshifts in the fuel mix, and examine how climate policy modifies the change in energy intensity and carbon intensity (Fig. 4c–f). The WITCH model reduces energy intensity significantly in response to a climate policy, while the other models only reduce energy intensity 20 to 30 %. Differences in results across models are due to differing assumptions about (1) the availability ofmore energy efficient technologies and the presence ofendogenous technical change, (2) the elasticity ofdemand, (3) the possibility to substitute energy with capital, and (4) the response of energy prices to climate policy. For example, GCAM is a technology-rich model with a low price elasticity ofdemand. With these assumptions, GCAM has a fairly low reduction in energy intensity. In WITCH, energy efficiency improvement is endogenously affected by R&D investments and climate policy, thus, setting a price on carbon induces an increase in those investments (see also De Cian et al. this issue). All models eventually reduce carbon intensity more than energy intensity, though with different time profiles. For example, WITCH points at the role of energy efficiency improvements in the short-term, while decarbonization plays a more important role in the long-run. This combination ofenergy efficiency measures and decarbonization is also due to the fact that some carbon free technologies are subject to endogenous learning and therefore are adopted more broadly in the long term when costs are lower. In contrast, GCAM and REMIND have more low carbon supply options, leading to a more significant reduction in carbon intensity than energy intensity While all models reduce their use of freely-venting fossil fuels under a climate policy, the choice of low-carbon fuels to replace them varies across models and to a lesser extent across scenarios (Fig. 5 and SM Figure 2). GCAM tends to deploy CO2 capture and storage (CCS) technologies to decarbonize the energy system in Continental Africa, while IPAC relies on increased nuclear and bioenergy. In Sub-Saharan Africa, both models rely on the use of BECCS, in addition to the expansion of renewable energy sources in REMIND and energy reductions in WITCH, to meet climate policy goals. All models suggest that Africa has a large mitigation potential compared to the global average (SM Figure 3). In the WITCH and REMIND models, Africa has a large potential for BECCS enabling more stringent reductions than in other regions. GCAM has similar potential for low-carbon fuels as other regions. However, Africa is a rapidly developing region and the model assumes it is easier to build new low-carbon capacity in such a region than shutdown or retrofit existing capacity in more developed regions.",346.924807

African energy intensity varies significantly across models in absolute terms, but there is agreement on the relative trends with higher energy intensity improvements being observed in scenarios with faster growth. Changes in energy intensity reflect the substitutability between capital and energy and assumptions about energy efficiency improvements over time. These improvements are exogenous in all models , except WITCH where they are endogenously linked to R&D investments. In contrast, carbon intensity is mostly affected by the composition of the energy mix (Figure 3 and Figure 1 in the Supplementary Material, SM). In most models and scenarios, we observe a shift away from traditional biomass  to more modern energy carriers and fossil fuels throughout the century (Fig. 3). However, the degree of electrification, but also the employment of various fossil fuels in the form of liquids, solids or gases is very different across models. GCAM, IPAC, and REMIND, which show a sharp increase in carbon intensity in the first half of the century, feature a higher increase in final energy from coal (other solids), while in the WITCH model, traditional biomass continues to account for a large share of final energy. Solids use is largely reduced by 2100 in all models, and replaced to a large extend by electricity . By the end of the century, models with lower carbon intensities (IPAC and REMIND) are associated to higher electrification rates. Differences in the sources of energy used for the production of electricity further contribute to differences in carbon intensity levels across models, with GCAM and WITCH relying more on fossil fuels, REMIND on greater deployment of solar  and IPAC on nuclear (SM Figure 1). Overall, carbon intensity appears to be mostly model-specific, and with the exception of IPAC, it shows very little variation with economic growth assumptions. Only the BAU HI Pop Scenario shows a lower increase in carbon intensity of energy. In IPAC, the BAU FS Gr Scenario has a strong decline in carbon intensity, due to the increased use of nuclear energy mentioned above. Compared to the global trends , in most scenarios African energy intensity declines faster than the world average, with the range varying between −3.6 and −1.3 %. In contrast, the carbon intensity grows more rapidly than the world average in most models and scenarios. REMIND and WITCH, which represent Sub-Saharan Africa, show the largest rates of energy intensity reduction and of carbon intensity increase.",346.896477

However, despite the harmonization in GDP per capita and population, models foresee a broad range in baseline final energy and CO2 emissions (Fig. 1), even when accounting for different geographical definitions ofAfrica. Final energy consumption growth rates (2005–2100) vary between 1.2 % (BAU HI Pop in WITCH) and 2.4 % (BAU FS Gr in REMIND) per year in Sub-Saharan Africa and between 1.5 % (BAU HI Pop in IPAC) and 2.3 % (BAU FS Gr in GCAM) per year in Continental Africa. The resulting variation in energy consumption in 2100 indicates that models embed very different views about the relationship between income and energy services, energy efficiency, and the cost and availability of different fuel carriers and technologies, and their evolution throughout the century. In all models, the BAU HI Pop Scenario has the lowest final energy consumption. Although this scenario has approximately one billion more people in 2100 than the other scenarios, GDP per capita is significantly lower (see Table 1). The latter effect dominates, resulting in lower energy consumption. Energy system CO2 emissions grow between 2.7 % (BAU HI Pop in WITCH) and 3.8 % (BAU FS Gr in REMIND) per year (2005–2100) in Sub-Saharan Africa and between 1.6 % (BAU HI Pop in IPAC) and 2.9 % (BAU FS Gr in GCAM) in Continental Africa. For three of the models, the BAU FS Gr Scenario has the highest CO2 emissions in 2100, followed by BAU DEF, BAU SL Gr, and finally BAU HI Pop. In the case ofIPAC, faster growth is associated to increased use of nuclear energy, both in absolute terms and percentage terms, and therefore lower fossil fuel use and lower emissions compared to the BAU SL Gr and BAU DEF Scenarios.

All four models represent Africa, though with different geographical aggregations. In REMIND and WITCH, Africa represents Sub-Saharan Africa, while in GCAM and IPAC it represents the whole continent, including North Africa and South Africa . The scenarios explored in this paper have been developed within the framework ofthe RoSE project (see Kriegler et al. this issue). We focus on four baseline and four policy scenarios that allow examining the role of economic and population growth  under two policy regimes (nopolicy baseline and 550 ppmv CO2 equivalent stabilization target). Three of the sets of the economic-population growth assumptions, namely slow, medium, and fast economic growth (respectively BAU FS Gr, BAU DEF and BAU SL Gr Scenarios for baseline, and 550 FS Gr, 550 DEF, and 550 SL Gr for policy) assume medium population. In this case, African population stabilizes after 2050 and in 2100 accounts for 28 % of the world’s population (87 % of which live in Sub-Saharan Africa)3. The fourth set of assumptions represents a pessimistic pathway characterized by very low per capita income, driven by high population, slow growth and slow convergence across world regions (BAU HI Pop Scenario for baseline and 550 HI Pop for policy). The BAU HI Pop baseline echoes a vision of a fragmented world, where extreme poverty, regionalism, and high population could increase the vulnerability of economies heavily dependent on agriculture, making them more vulnerable to climate change impacts. It is important to note that these scenarios were designed to explore the sensitivity of energy and emissions to population and GDP assumptions, not to explore uncertainty. Therefore results presented in this paper should not be construed as a full uncertainty range. The different models implemented the scenarios by modifying exogenous parameters in such a way to replicate the specified assumptions for population and economic growth (see Table 1)4. Specifically, in all models population was exogenously set to match the figures provided in the 2008 Revision of the UN Population Prospects (UN 2009). GDP per capita trajectories were replicated by adjusting the productivity of all production factors (WITCH) or of labor (REMIND, GCAM, IPAC). Further, fossil fuel resource availability and extraction costs have also been harmonized, but no attempt has been made to harmonize energy intensity. In the next section we explore the implications of baseline scenarios on the future energy system and emissions. We also examine the implications of limiting CO2-equivalent concentrations to 550 ppmv in the different population and economic growth scenarios.",346.99531

In 2009, continental Africa accounted for 3.2 % ofglobal CO2 fossil fuel emissions and Sub-Saharan Africa for less than 1 % ofglobal emissions (IEA 2010). Emissions are low because economic activity is smaller than in other regions and most of the population still lacks access to electricity and clean-burning fuels (Pachauri et al. 2013). Currently, Africa produces only 4 % of global Gross Domestic Product (GDP) (Newell and Iler 2013) and it uses only 5.9 % of the global final energy (IEA 2010). However, African population could grow significantly in the future and, by 2100, more than 25 % of the world’s population could live there (UN Population Division 2009). By dint of sheer numbers, Africa could become a place to be reckoned with. Africa’s future energy use and share of global emissions will depend on socioeconomic, technical, and political factors that will shape its energy intensity of GDP and the carbon intensity of energy. Economic growth is only one face of the medal. Consider for example France and the United States. They have similar per capita income, but per capita emissions in the United States are three times those of France. This difference is driven by a number offactors, including the heavy reliance on nuclear power in France, the preference for big cars, and the very low efficiency levels of buildings in the US. Which development pathway Africa follows will influence its emissions and could potentially impact global emissions due to the projected size of Africa’s population. Given the very low level of per capita income in Africa today, many different development pathways are possible and Africa’s emission pathway over the coming century remains highly uncertain. Economic growth is, however, a very approximate indicator of human well-being and development. Future development in Africa will necessitate extending access and supplies of modern energy to most of its population. Sub-Saharan Africa has lagged far behind the rest of the world in providing its population with access to electricity (only 14 % of rural and 63 % of urban residents were electrified in 2010) and modern fuels (over 80 % still rely on traditional solid fuels for cooking) (WB 2013). Evidence of the pivotal catalytic role of access to adequate, affordable, reliable and suitable energy types for lifting people out of poverty and enhancing their welfare is irrefutable (Cabraal et al. 2005; Desai et al. 2004; Modi et al. 2005; Pachauri et al. 2012). The linkage between economic activity, energy use, and emissions has been extensively analyzed globally and for several key regions, such as the United States, Europe, China, and India (Nakicenovic and Swart 2000; Blanford et al. 2009; Blanford et al. 2012). A similar assessment is lacking for Africa. Indeed, very few future scenarios exist for the African continent. They either focus on selected countries (e.g. South Africa, see Winkler et al. 2011; Erickson et al. 2009, or Eritrea, see Buskirk 2006), or when larger in scope, on the first half of this century (EIA 2013a, b; IEA 2010, 2012; MIT 2012). Modeling comparison exercises, such as the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (Nakicenovic and Swart 2000) and the Energy Modeling Forum studies (see Clarke et al. 2009, for example) have also never focused on this region and commonly Africa has either been grouped with other large regions or only included in world totals. Bigger economies have attracted the attention of regional modeling comparison exercises, such as Europe (Böhringer et al. 2009), USA (Clarke et al. 2007; Fawcett et al. 2009), China and India (Calvin et al. 2012). Admittedly, the lack of scenarios and historical data for some African countries makes the process of model calibration and evaluation more challenging for this region.",347.00053

Our results suggest that population and economic growth rates will strongly influence Africa’s future energy use and emissions. We show that affluence is only one face of the medal and the range of future emissions is also contingent on technological and political factors. Higher energy intensity improvements occur when Africa grows faster. In contrast, climate intensity varies less with economic growth and it is mostly driven by climate policy. African emissions could account for between 5 % and 20 % of global emissions, with Sub-Saharan Africa contributing between 4 % and 10 % ofworld emissions in 2100. In all scenarios considered, affluence levels remain low until the middle of the century, suggesting that the population could remain dependent on traditional bioenergy to meet most residential energy needs.

A scenario thus dictates the degree of availability of some technology groups. Alternatively, one may consider that society may act to modify the availability of each group. In the first case, the results can be used to act in a manner contingent on which scenario is eventually revealed in the real world. In the second, more proactive view, the results help advise technological policies toward those technologies that are most useful to attain the climate target. Reality may well fall in-between these two views, inasmuch as some technology groups may prove too difficult to promote (due to societal resistance, natural causes, or unforeseen obstacles, such as the difficulty of managing nuclear waste, or the visual pollution of wind power). At any rate, the results of our research and of similar analyses) constitute a useful guide to evaluate the technological strategies needed to reach a severe climate target. What our study shows is that biomass based technologies are both effective and cost efficient for abating GHG emissions, irrespective of other technological developments. Nuclear is also an effective option in all cases, but, contrary to biomass, its absence does not increase climate cost much, therefore its cost-efficiency is limited. The effectiveness of Solar/Wind electricity varies greatly depending on the availability of other technologies, but when it is needed, its cost efficiency is high. Similarly, CCS is most effective (and efficient) when biomass is abundant, or when the solar/wind potential is low. This clearly indicates that focusing on the interplay ofthese three technology sets lies at the heart ofclimate policy. The case of end-use energy efficiency is different: our work shows that low end-use energy intensity is (of course) greatly desirable, but this conclusion rests at least partly on the overly optimistic assumption that it will happen at no extra cost. The cost analysis illustrates the law of diminishing returns: compounding two pessimistic assumptions costs more than the sum of the costs of the two assumptions separately. We also wish to point out at a caveat regarding our evaluation of solar and wind electricity: although the model explicitly accounts for the low availability of intermittent electricity sources (for establishing the capacity reserve required to cover seasonal/diurnal fluctuations of electricity demand), it does not fully include the costs required for the adaptation of electricity networks needed to accept a high proportion of intermittent sources.

Then, it uses CCS and NBR in variable amounts, but these two options are somewhat negatively correlated: whenever CCS is high, NBR tends to be lower, which means that the two technology groups are partial substitutes. In contrast, NBR level correlates positively with total electricity, which means that when total electricity increases, the increase is mainly from NBR sources. Therefore, NBR and Total electricity are partial complements. Biomass and nuclear are uncorrelated to the other variables, since we have observed that both penetrate close to their upper limits whenever allowed to do so. Another association evident from Table 3 is that whenever biomass is constrained to be low, it triggers an increase in NBR electricity, but not ofCCS.

We examine global costs in two ways. The first part of Table 2 shows the net present value of each climate scenario relative to that scenario’s baseline. Each entry of that table is therefore the loss oftotal surplus incurred for implementing the climate target (called climate cost for short) under the corresponding technological conditions. It is immediately apparent from these results that the two scenarios with low energy intensity (G10 and G16) carry the two lowest climate costs of attaining the climate target. Scenario G10 (the most optimistic) has a cost that is considerably lower than any other in the experiment. Interestingly enough, G16 (Low EI, but No CCS and Nuclear Off) is the next cheaper scenario, in spite of having unfavourable limits on CCS and Nuclear energy. This points out at the crucial advantage conferred by the low energy intensity assumption. One should remember however that low end-use energy intensity is assumed to be achievable at no extra cost in our experiment, in contrast with the case of the other technology groups. In the group of scenarios with Reference EI, scenario G9 (all favourable except EI) is the least costly one, as expected. Then come G12 (NucOff) and G13 (LimSW), with climate costs only 7 % higher than G9. The next cluster of climate costs are those of scenarios G14 (LimBio) and G11 (NoCCS), with climate costs more than 40 % higher than the cost of G9. Scenario G15 (Conv, meaning constrained Wind and Solar and Low biomass potential) carries a higher cost still, since it combines the two disadvantages ofscenarios G13 and G14. Another useful way to look at costs is used in the second part ofTable 2, which contains the differences of the climate costs between each scenario and scenario G9 taken as reference. These costs may be used to rank the technology groups. The analysis allows us to make a rough ranking of the technology groups: among the ‘one-up’ scenarios (i.e. the first six scenarios, where only one technology assumption is changed relative to “AllTech”), the single most desirable one is clearly the Low EI one with a large negative relative cost, easily explained since it is due to a major, no-cost reduction of end-use energy intensity. The second most desirable technology assumption is the availability of CCS, the third most desirable is High Biomass, then Advanced Solar and Wind, and finally Nuclear, in decreasing order of desirability.

It is an incarnation of the TIMES economic paradigm, which is the computation of a dynamic inter-temporal partial equilibrium on energy and emission markets based on the maximization of total surplus. A complete description of the TIMES equations appears in www.etsap.org/documentation. TIAM-WORLD was developed by the three authors and has been used in many international and European projects (Labriet et al. 2012; Loulou et al. 2009). It is described in Loulou-Labriet (2008), but the model is in constant enhancement. TIAM-WORLD represents the energy system of the World divided in 16 regions. The model integrates all stages of the energy system: procurement, transformation, trade, and end-use of a large number of energy forms over the period 2005–2100. The current version is calibrated to the 2005 statistics of the International Energy Agency augmented by more detailed data in several sectors. The current version of TIMES-World contains explicit descriptions of approximately 1500 technologies and 300 commodities in each region, interrelated in a Reference Energy System. Such technological detail allows precise tracking of capital turnover, and provides a precise description of technological and fuel competition. The long-distance trade of energy between the regions of TIAM-WORLD is endogenously modeled for all main energy forms and emissions. The model is driven by a set of 42 demands for energy services in agriculture, residential, commercial, industry, and transportation. Demands for energy services are user specified for the Reference scenario, and are own price elastic. Thus, each demand varies endogenously in alternate scenarios, in response to endogenous price changes of the energy service. Although the model does not encompass macroeconomic variables beyond the energy sector, elastic demands capture the price portion of the feedback effects between energy system and economy (Bataille 2005). The surplus maximization is subject to many constraints defined on a regional, sector or global basis, such as: supply bounds (in the form of multi-stepped supply curves) for the primary resources, technical constraints governing the creation, operation, and abandonment of each technology, balance constraints for all energy forms and emissions, timing of investment payments and other cash flows, and the satisfaction of a set of demands for energy services in all sectors of the economy. The CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions related to the energy sector are explicitly represented by the energy technologies included in the model. The emissions from non-energy sectors (landfills, manure, rice paddies, enteric fermentation, wastewater, agriculture, land-use) are also included in the model. The other greenhouse gases (CFC’s, HFC’s, SF6, etc.) are not explicitly modeled, but their radiative forcing is represented in an exogenous manner, following the assumptions proposed by EMF-27. TIAM-WORLD includes a climate module permitting the endogenous computation of global changes in GHG concentrations (CO2, CH4, N2O), radiative forcings, and temperature increase (surface and ocean). The other forcing agents, not explicitly modeled in TIAM-WORLD, are defined exogenously. In the current application, the Kyoto gases forcing was used as a climate target, including CO2, CH4, N2O and F-gases; it was fixed at 2.89 W/m2 in the 450 ppm case. Such a target translates as a 450 ppmv CO2 equivalent concentration (i.e. a 2.63 W/m2 total forcing) when all climate warming substances are accounted for. The climate module was calibrated and validated to a reasonable precision by comparing it to more detailed climate models and to other models used in the EMF-27 program.",345.84122

A very rough characterization ofthe policy approach is to negotiate emissions quotas to be attributed to countries, and leave the task of implementing them to nations, or groups of nations. The technological approach consists in identifying technologies that emit less or no GHG’s and that could replace existing, emitting ones, and in promoting the use of these technologies as rapidly as feasible (Latin 2012). Such an approach tends to focus only on the effectiveness of the emission abatement and to ignore the cost efficiency dimension of the abatement strategy. In fact, the two approaches (“policy” and “technology”) need not be opposed, inasmuch as the technological adoption strategy could well be guided by setting an agreed upon climate target and attaining it in a cost efficient way. Moreover, considering policy and technology approaches as interdependent, may help in international negotiations, since policies — whether national, regional, or global, eventually need to consider the explicit technologies that are required in order to respect the emissions quotas; and technological solutions in turn require policies in order to be implemented. Therefore, the difference between policy based and technological approaches to climate mitigation is, in part at least, a difference of perspective. In this article, we focus on technology adoption in order to respect a strict climate target, and we ignore the detailed policies that may be required to implement the preferred technological adoptions. Our contribution to the climate change debate is to identify a set of technological scenarios that have the two properties of(a) effectiveness — i.e. achieving the specified climate target via a set of coherent actions, and (b) cost efficiency — i.e. doing so at minimum social cost. The careful analysis of these scenarios may then be used to inform the policies to implement them. Our model is indeed regionalized, although the present article focuses only on global results. We adopt the multi-scenario framework set by the 27th Energy Modeling Forum (EMF-27). Each technological scenario makes specific assumptions about the five groups oftechnologies — described in Table 1, that are susceptible to play a role in emission abatement. Such an approach helps in understanding the complementarity of the different technology options in climate policies. Section 2 describes the scenarios in more precise terms.

The main insights obtained from the assessment show the prominent role ofbioenergy as a means to abate greenhouse gas emissions, irrespective of other technological developments, while the role of the other technologies (wind and solar, carbon capture and sequestration, nuclear) are more dependent of one another. It appears that CCS may play a sort of “backstop” role: it compensates for a lower contribution of solar and wind, or of nuclear. This means that an increased social acceptability ofone (or all) ofthese three sets oftechnology should be at the heart of future climate policies.

Of course EI is even lower for scenarios G10 and G16, both of which exogenously assume low EI to start with. More minor but still significant additional energy savings are endogenously adopted by the model when technological assumptions are very unfavorable, such as in scenario G15 (27 % rather than 22 %). CO2 Capture and Storage: leaving aside scenarios G11 and G16, where CCS is constrained at 0 level, we observe wide variations in the adoption of capture and storage of CO2, ranging from 500 Gt to more than 1,600 Gt of CO2 over the 21st century. The lowest levels of CCS are in G10 (LowEI), and G14 (LimBio): G10 does not require much CCS because its high end-use energy efficiency (EUEE) provides a more economical way of reducing emissions, whereas CCS is less used in G14 because CCS is less attractive when the biomass potential is low. This implies that Biomass CCS is a preferred combination over the use of CCS with other energy production technologies; we shall return to this point in Section 4.3. The next lowest CCS value is for G11 (NucOff), showing that the absence of new nuclear plants is only a rather minor impediment to achieving the target, a fact we already noted when looking at the costs in Table 2. The two scenarios with highest CCS levels are G13 and G15, i.e. the two scenarios where renewable electricity is severely limited, making it imperative to implement other abatement actions, namely CCS. A more detailed analysis of CCS is presented in Section 4.3. Nuclear energy: as already noted, nuclear power is not a crucial technology for climate mitigation, since its absence is rather easily compensated for by other technologies. However, we do observe that whenever available, nuclear power is almost always fully utilized. We complete the discussion of nuclear penetration by noting that the climate constraint does trigger more nuclear than in the baselines. Indeed, the total nuclear electricity produced in the century, for those baselines that allow it, amounts to 1724 EJ, i.e. less than half what it is in the corresponding climate scenarios. Non Biomass Renewables (NBR1): Again, the two scenarios with low Energy intensity exhibit low (G10) or moderately high (G16) levels of NBR, because the target is then relatively easier to reach than with other assumptions. In G13 and G15, Solar and Wind electricity are severely restricted, and therefore total NBR remains fairly low. NBR penetrates at a moderately high level in G9 and G12, because these two scenarios are well endowed with other technological options, as already noted. The two highest penetration levels for NBR are for the two scenarios that assume either no CCS (G11) or limited biomass (G14), as one would expect. Biomass: It is not surprising to see that when the biomass potential is low (scenarios G14, G15, G30), it is fully utilized. What is more interesting is that the potential is also fully used when it is assumed high, even in the most optimistic G10 scenario. This result establishes the high value of Biomass as a means ofmitigating emissions. We shall return to this point in Section 4.3. Electricity: leaving aside the two scenarios with low EI, for which electricity penetration is relatively low, we observe that the penetration is highest when the biomass potential is low (scenarios G14, G15). Indeed, biomass offers a potential for negative emissions when combined with capture; when its potential is reduced, the penetration of other low-carbon strategies such as renewable electricity must compensate for the reduced availability of negative emissions, hence the relatively higher contribution of renewable electricity. As we shall see in the next few paragraphs, this emphasizes how the high use of renewable electricity provides a viable alternative strategy to the Biomass CCS combination. We now turn to a summary of the mix of abatement options used in each scenario.",346.919134

The availability of BECCS in the long-term may allow for less reductions in the short-term. However, while economically attractive given the double contribution to mitigation, this requires a near-term assessment on the availability and impacts of BECCS in the long-term. In our discussion in Section 3, we have also indicated that the availability of BECCS technology is not certain at all. Current decisions therefore need to be taken in the context of this uncertainty. More reductions in the short-run (with additional costs) allow for a more flexible portfolio in the long run.

The IMAGE model provides a description of various systems relevant for global environmental change (Bouwman et al. 2006). The climate system is represented by parts of the MAGICC6 model, while the carbon cycle is represented by a detailed description of the interaction between the biosphere, oceans and the atmosphere. In the energy system, technologies are chosen based on relative costs (using multinomial logit equations), which in turn are determined by depletion and technology learning dynamics. Biomass can be used in the transport sector, in the power sector (with and without CCS) and other sectors. As a baseline for our calculations we used the recently developed scenario for the OECD Environmental Outlook 2012 (OECD 2012), assuming that no new climate policies are introduced. In this scenario energy-related CO2 emissions increase from nearly 30 GtCO2/year today to around 55 GtCO2/year in 2050 and more than 80 GtCO2 in 2100. Climate policies are induced by introducing a CO2-equivalent price. The calculations assume full participation of regions and sectors after 2012, and use a discount rate of 5 %. The use of BECCS is limited by similar constraints as discussed in Section 3 (note that afforestation and deforestation measures are not included in these IMAGE calculations). In the scenarios in which the use of BECCS is allowed, this technology indeed plays an important role. While the costs are seemingly high (it combines the additional costs of the bio-energy feedstock and the costs of CCS technology), the technology produces two services: production of electricity and storage of CO2. As a result, the technology is very competitive for moderate to stringent climate targets. In the scenarios shown here, the carbon price is high enough from 2030 onwards to induce large scale BECCS application (see Fig. 4). The total negative emissions in 2100 amount to about 4 GtCO2-eq/year. This is a net result of the negative contribution of BECCS (10–15 GtCO2/year) and remaining emissions in other sectors (like international transport). Already in the 2050–2060 period, the emissions of the power sector become net negative, reducing the mitigation pressure in other sectors. The influence of BECCS can also be seen from comparing scenarios with and without this technology. The 2.6 W/m2 target, in fact, becomes infeasible in the current model set-up. This is reported also for several other models (Clarke et al. 2010). For the 2.9 W/m2 target, the removal of BECCS leads to a cost increase. Moreover, with BECCS emission reductions can be somewhat postponed. Without BECCS, short-term emission reductions, in fact, need to be similar to the 2.6 W/m2 scenario (with a sharp peak in 2020). Figure 5 shows the impacts on the energy mix: to compensate for the lack of BECCS, the model needs to further increase energy efficiency and to decrease unabated fossil fuel use. This is done by significantly increasing natural gas and coal use with CCS and nuclear power. In addition, also the remaining oil use in (international) transport is reduced further. In the BECCS scenarios, the majority ofbio-energy is used in conjunction with CCS – and thus the use of bio-energy in the transport sector is significantly reduced (shown by a reduction of bio-energy use without CCS). At the same time, the total bio-energy consumption increases. For 2050, from 75 EJ/year in the baseline to 140 EJ/year in the mitigation run without BECCS and 150–170 EJ in the runs with BECCS (in all cases including residues). In 2075, these numbers are 80, 150 and 250 EJ/year. This also leads to corresponding changes in land use. In our scenario land for food production is projected to peak around 2025 (driven by a slowdown in population growth combined with further productivity improvement in the agricultural system). In the mitigation cases, the additional land for bio-energy amounts to around 0.3-0.6 Gha during the second half of the century or about 20-30 % of the area required for crop production (1.4-1.7 Gha). As discussed earlier, these numbers are subject to considerable uncertainty, both in terms of the required area (depending on the assumed technology improvements in the production of bio-energy and yields) and associated GHG emissions.",346.02189

Afforestation/reforestation (AR) forms a reasonable alternative to BECCS, although negative emissions can only be achieved after first substantially reducing current deforestation emissions. Studies on potential from AR report both technical and economic potential and more realistic estimates taking into account all kind of practical limitations. Kindermann et al. (2008) report that substantial emission reductions can be obtained from reducing deforestation. Strengers et al. (2008) report a mitigation potential from afforestation up to 10 GtCO2/year in the 2010–2050 period under the most optimistic assumptions, but indicate that a number around 4 GtCO2/year would be more realistic. In pessimistic cases, however, there would be no realistic potential. These numbers are reasonably consistent with the estimate of 1.3–4.2 GtCO2-eq/year reported by the IPCC 4th Assessment Report. Obviously, bio-energy potential and AR potential may compete for the same land. Another point is that both bio-energy and afforestation measures could, if introduced at a large scale, not only lead to carbon sequestration but also to biophysical impacts on climate, such as albedo changes. These impacts are still uncertain given our current understanding of the interaction between land-use change and climate (e.g. impacts of deforestation and land-use change in the Amazon rainforest or Africa). There is more consensus on the impact ofland-use change in snow-covered areas in the temperate zone, where large scale reforestation measures could lead to a net warming impact (Betts 2000; Schaeffer et al. 2006).",346.0267

First of all, the storage capacity for CO2 is uncertain: while there is some certainty about the safety of storing CO2 in empty fossil-fuel reservoirs, the potential of safe storage in other categories (such as coal-beds, saline aquifers or even in the ocean) is more uncertain. Second, societal acceptance is at least as an important constraint (Johnsson et al. 2009). Local communities have successfully opposed CCS projects, based on (perceived) risks (Brunsting et al. 2011). From a fully technical perspective, Hendriks et al. (2004) estimated the global storage capacity based on different assumptions to range from 500 to around 10,000 GtCO2 (Fig. 3). Fossil-fuel reservoirs capacity (the most certain part) range from 500 to around 3000 GtCO2. A recent study of the International Energy Agency finds somewhat lower numbers in most regions, but considerably higher numbers in the USA (IEAGHG 2011). As a result, their total global estimate is slightly higher, while the fossil fuel part was estimated at 600 to 2500 GtCO2. Assuming that CCS is mostly used in the second half of the century, the total capacity use of empty oil and gas fields allows for an average annual storage rate of 10 to more than 65 GtCO2/year. Including coal seams and aquifers would move the high-end range upwards considerably. The same reservoirs, however, could also be potentially used to store the CO2 generated from fossil-fuels, lowering the available space for BECCS. This implies that under the most optimistic estimates, the storage capacity will not be limiting BECCS capacity at the global level (although capacity could run out in specific, densely populated, regions such Korea, Japan and India). Under pessimistic assumptions, however, the potential for BECCS could be seriously constrained by the storage capacity (technically maybe 10 GtCO2/year, but social acceptance could reduce this number to zero). Also the maximum storage rate and CCS costs could play a role in the uncertainty. The latter are determined by the capture, transport and storage costs, and quite some progress is still needed to increase the competitiveness of BECCS (see, for instance, IPCC 2005; GCCSI 2011).",345.95029

Several concerns have been raised. First of all, there are competing claims on scarce land resources from food production, timber production and bio-energy production. In the next four decades, it is likely that an increase of agricultural production of around 60 % will be required in order to feed 9 billion people with increasingly meat-intensive diets (IAASTD 2009; Smith et al. 2010). At the same time, there are indications that even producing relatively small amounts of bio-energy have contributed to lifted food prices (Rosegrant 2008). Assuming that a sustainable bio-energy potential should not threaten food security, the potential for bio-energy strongly depends on the development in the agricultural system (in particular its productivity increase). Equally important are limitations posed by biodiversity protection, water scarcity and prevention of soil degradation. Finally, also the potential GHG emissions associated with bio-energy production need to be taken into account (Crutzen et al. 2007; Dornburg et al. 2010; Searchinger et al. 2008; Smeets et al. 2009; Wicke et al. 2012; Wise et al. 2009). The ability ofBECCS to result in net negative emissions obviously depends on the size of these emissions. For production of woody bio-energy for use in power stations, the conversion emissions are typically low: relatively little processing ofthe biomass is needed (compared to for instance the production of biofuel), and woody bioenergy can (depending on the management system) be produced with very little fertilizer input (Van Vuuren et al. 2010b). The net impact on GHG emissions, therefore, mostly depends on land-use change associated CO2 emissions, either directly (at the location of woody bio-energy production) or indirectly (displacement of other activities). Estimates of these emissions vary strongly: they can be as high as the emissions associated with fossil fuels or even be negative if bio-energy production contributes to improvement of degraded soils (Nijsen et al. 2011; Searchinger et al. 2008; Tilman et al. 2006) . Van Vuuren et al. (2009; 2010a) looked into the sustainable bio-energy production potential under various assumptions. They show that the sustainable potential in 2050 may vary between 0 and 200 EJ/year depending on a range of assumptions regarding the factors mentioned above. A typical value would be around 150 EJ/year for the sum of purpose-grown bio-energy and residues (assuming sites would produce around 5–10 ton dry matter per hectare per year). By 2100, this value may be around 250 EJ/year. The literature review by Dornburg et al. (2010) shows a comparable range. Assuming that 1) all bio-energy would be used in BECCS plants, 2) a capture efficiency of 90 % and 3) a land-use related emission factor associated with the production of bio-energy of 15 kg CO2 per GJ, it is easy to calculate that the absolute maximum total potential for negative emissions would be in the order of10 GtCO2/year in 2050 and 20 GtCO2 in 2100. An emission of15 kg CO2 per GJ is based on some review of the literature and calculations using the IMAGE model, and reduces the net effectiveness of BECCS by about one fifth (but as discussed above there is a considerable uncertainty range). It should be noted that the BECCS potential is likely to be smaller as a result of competition with other forms of bio-energy use such as the transport sector and the production of materials.",346.916564

It should be noted even small differences in the 2020 reduction target are of key importance given the large share of emissions already ‘committed’ as part of the current energy infrastructure and existing policies. Figure 1 shows the results of these calculations. In nearly all cases that do not include negative emissions, 2020 emissions need already be reduced significantly. For instance, assuming a maximum reduction rate of 2.5 %/year, global emissions need to be around the 2000 level in 2020 and 10 % below baseline. Only, if a long-term 4 % emission reduction rate is achievable, the 2020 emission reductions could be limited. In all cases without negative emissions, 2050 emissions are around 60–80 % below the 2000 level in order to meet the overall cumulative emission budget. In fact, if emissions cannot be reduced to zero, the need for short-term emission reductions is even more urgent (see panel b). For instance, assuming the emission cannot be reduced lower than 5 GtCO2/year implies that 2020 emissions would need to be reduced to 25 % below the baseline in order to reach the 2 °C target. The situation changes substantially if negative emissions are assumed to be possible: the urgency for near term emission reductions becomes much less (panel c). We have looked at a negative emission rate of −6 and −10 GtCO2/year. The required 2020 emission reductions are significantly smaller: 0–10 % compared to baseline for assumed emission reduction rates of 2–3 %/year; for a 4 % emission reduction rate it is even possible to allow no reduction in 2020. The 2020 consequences are summarized in panel d. With these insights, it is useful to look at the IAM calculations where similar results have been obtained. Clarke et al. (2010), for instance, show that those models that are able to meet low GHG concentrations include BECCS in the assumed portfolio. Van Vuuren and Riahi (2011) look into this in more detail based on an extensive set of published scenarios. They summarize their results for the three lowest categories defined in the Fourth Assessment Report of IPCC (these categories are defined on the basis of the 2100 radiative forcing level). The lowest category is consistent with a high likelihood of achieving the 2 °C target. Figure 2 shows the scenarios within this category. Given the more complex model dynamics, the results are somewhat less extreme than those shown in Fig. 1. Here, the illustrative calculations above explain why a direct relationship can be observed between 2020 emission levels and the assumptions on long-term negative emissions.",345.934427

We will illustrate the importance using some very simple calculations. & First of all, we assume that for reaching the 2 °C target the cumulative 2000–2100 emission budget (land use and energy) needs to be equal to1600 GtCO2. & We assume that across the century emissions are reduced linearly (as a result of a strategy to spread the emission reduction burden across time) equal to a percentage of 2000 emissions.

Studies by Meinshausen et al. (2009) and Allen et al. (2009), for instance, showed that the CO2 emission budget in the next four decades would be the best predictor of the probability of achieving the target. Restricted by the available scenario studies at the time, the Meinshausen et al. (2009) study did not consider negative emission scenarios. In a recent study, that uses a similar approach based on the MAGICC model as Meinshausen et al. (2009), negative scenarios have been included (Van Vuuren et al. 2012). The new MAGICC calculations from Van Vuuren et al. (2012) cover a wide range of scenarios with different time profiles as published in recent IAM models. Within this range of time profiles (based on IAM assumption on economic and technical constraints) a clear relationship between the carbon budget and long-term climate targets remains. Different results for non-CO2 emissions form the single most important factor complicating the relation. But also higher short-term emissions compensated by long-term negative emissions influence a budget approach, clearly for short-term budgets but also for long-term budgets. For instance, higher CO2 concentrations result in a higher absorption rate of oceans and biosphere, increasing the budget as a function of the level of overshoot (Wigley et al. 1996). Higher temperatures, however, could lead to positive climate-carbon cycle feedbacks such a reduced growth of the biosphere or the release of GHGs from tundra areas (Friedlingstein et al. 2001; Friedlingstein et al. 2006), leading to a lower budget. For the sake of simplification, in the remainder of this section, we assume that the carbon budget is independent of the emission profile. The results of Van Vuuren et al. show that, on average, an ambition to meet the 2 °C target with a probability around 66 % corresponds with a maximum CO2 emissions budget across the century of 1600 GtCO2. For comparison, the average baseline emission scenario ofthe recent model comparison study (EMF-22) leads to an emission of more than 5200 GtCO2, i.e. more than 3 times the allowable emission budget (Clarke et al. 2010). Apart from the long-term climate target, several other factors also determine the emission reduction pathway, including: 1) the rate at which emissions can be reduced and 2) the total reduction potential, as defined by long-term technology development. 1. The emission reduction rate is bounded by several factors (Den Elzen et al. 2010; Kramer and Haigh 2009). First ofall, technology has a certain lifetime and premature replacement is expensive. The typical lifetime ofa fossil-fuel power plant, for instance, is around 40 years (Philibert 2007). Similar lifetimes hold for plants in industry. While the lifetime of other technologies, such as a passenger car, can be much shorter, also the lifetime ofthe associated infrastructure can be relevant (fuelling stations; car factories etc.). Other important factors are the inertia in the change of consumer preferences, international negotiation processes, policy formulation and the maximum deployment rate of new technologies. These factors are very uncertain and typically not captured in energy-economic models. Earlier, we found that in existing scenarios for ambitious climate targets hardly any period is found with a reduction rate of 4 %/year (compared to 2000 emission levels) for 10 years or more (Den Elzen et al. 2010). Even a 4 % emission reduction rate requires a decarbonisation rate of 6 %, assuming an average income growth of2 %. Historically, high global decarbonisation rates are in the order of 2 %/year (achieved over relatively short time periods). 2. A second key factor is the total reduction potential. In some sectors, emissions can be reduced to zero over time. For instance, in the power sector several alternative options exist that can all significantly reduce emissions (renewables, CCS, nuclear power). In other sectors, however, potential seems to be more limited. For instance, for some transport modes like aviation and freight transport reduction potential seems to be currently limited to energy efficiency and the use ofbio-energy (Riahi et al. 2012), while bio-energy use is likely to generate at least some GHG emissions (Searchinger et al. 2008; Smeets et al. 2009). Also for several non-CO2 emission sources, it will be hard to reduce emissions to zero (Lucas et al. 2007; Van Vuuren et al. 2006).",346.92584

The projected change in climate associated with ‘business-as-usual’ scenarios could very well lead to considerable impacts, such as reduction of agricultural production, biodiversity loss, sea level rise and extreme weather events (Hansen et al. 2008; Hare et al. 2011; Parry et al. 2007). Based on the available scientific evidence, policy makers have proposed to use the so-called 2 °C target (a maximum increase of global mean temperature above pre-industrial levels) as an important objective for international climate policy (UNFCCC 2010). Several studies have indicated the daunting implications of the 2 °C target (Edenhofer et al. 2010; Meinshausen et al. 2006; Van Vuuren et al. 2007): assuming that policies would aim to achieve such a target with a probability of more than 50 % (based on the climate sensitivity uncertainty), global GHG emissions would need to be halved in the next 40 years and to a level close to zero in the second half of the century. In contrast, historical trends so-far have resulted in an almost continuous increase in GHG emissions. So-far, international negotiations have made little progress in formulating effective international climate policies. While it is even not certain that current pledges to the Copenhagen Agreement will be successfully implemented, they would certainly not lead to the emission levels associated with least-costs ‘2 °C target’ pathways (Den Elzen et al. 2011; Rogelj et al. 2011; Van Vliet et al. 2012). There is also no evidence that ongoing negotiations for policies beyond 2020 will be more successful, although decision-makers proposed a new round of negotiations in Durban. A possible way to deal with this is the consideration of so-called overshoot scenarios (Den Elzen and Van Vuuren 2007; Huntingford and Lowe 2007; Wigley et al. 2007). Concentration overshoot scenarios allow, for a limited period of time, for higher concentration levels than those consistent with long-term temperature targets. Such (limited) overshoot scenarios can be attractive as they require less short-term reductions and seem to have only limited additional risks (Den Elzen and Van Vuuren 2007). Temperature overshoot scenarios can also be considered, but these clearly bear additional risks as the higher temperature levels will obviously cause climate impacts and it will take considerable time to return to the proposed target (Solomon et al. 2009). Increased temperature levels could cause feedbacks that would result in further climate change (e.g. the temperature feedback on the carbon cycle, that reduces the uptake of carbon by ecosystems (Friedlingstein et al. 2006)). Many (concentration) overshoot scenarios aim to profit from net negative emissions in the second half of the century (Azar et al. 2006; Azar et al. 2010; O’Neill et al. 2010; Read and Lermit 2005; Van Vuuren et al. 2007). Net negative emissions can be achieved in different ways. Important options include bio-energy combined with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) (Azar et al. 2010; Obersteiner et al. 2001; Read and Lermit 2005), reforestation and afforestation (Canadell and Raupach 2008; Nabuurs et al. 2007; Obersteiner et al. 2006) and forms of geo-engineering, carbon dioxide removal or CDR such as capturing CO2 directly from the air and ocean fertilization (The Royal Society 2009). Carbon storage in soils through the use ofbiochar (Galinato et al. 2011) or by producing bio-energy on degraded grasslands could possibly contribute to negative emissions as well (Tilman et al. 2006). Of these options, direct air capture is relatively expensive, while ocean fertilization (and many other forms of geo-engineering) bear serious environmental risks (The Royal Society 2009). As such, BECCS and reforestation would arguably be the most attractive options to create negative emissions. In this paper, we briefly explore the demand and supply of negative emissions by the use of BECCS. For this, we first illustrate the importance of the possibility of negative emissions in future for the decisions policymakers face today using a set of stylized emission pathways. Next, we discuss the possible supply of negative emissions from BECCS by discussing the potential for bio-energy and CCS. Finally, we use the Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) IMAGE to illustrate the implications of BECCS use for the energy system and climate policy in actual IAM based scenarios.",345.844876

Both stylized calculations and model runs show that without the possibility of negative emissions, pathways meeting the 2 °C target with high probability need almost immediate emission reductions or simply become infeasible. The potential for negative emissions is uncertain. We show that negative emissions from BECCS are probably limited to around 0 to 10 GtCO2/year in 2050 and 0 to 20 GtCO2/year in 2100. Estimates on the potential of afforestation options are in the order of 0–4 GtCO2/year.

On account of the detailed specification of energy technologies in REMIND-R, this hybrid model is well-equipped to support the investigation of alternative technology scenarios. One key result is that having a large and diverse portfolio of technologies available for use to varying degrees is efficient for minimizing mitigation costs and also as a technology-development strategy. Although the option values of single technologies differ significantly in a given simulation environment, that environment can change. In the scenarios here considered, nuclear technologies can be replaced at very low costs, giving them a low option value. CCS technologies and renewable technologies are more important. For a scenario that requires negative emissions to reach the 400ppm CO2eq concentrations goal by 2150, biomass technologies in conjunction with CCS are essential. If all technology options are available, the climate target of stabilizing the atmospheric GHG concentration at around 400ppm CO2eq can be achieved by costs of around 0.97% of world baseline consumption. Mitigation costs are much higher if the annual biomass potential is constrained to values of 100 EJ or less. REMIND-R considers the interdependence of investment and international trade decisions, of technological development, and the choice of technology options. Incorporating these linkages clearly improves the quality of mitigation cost estimates. Global and regional variation of mitigation costs may be due to gains and losses from emissions trading, demand and supply changes on the energy resource market, and the resulting terms-of-trade effects. While the current account structure differs little between the business-as-usual baseline and the climate policy scenario, climate policies as well as technology scenarios can change the patterns of energy trade substantially. The pattern of changes in composite good trade is the mirror image of the changes on the carbon and resource market. In the policy scenario relative to baseline, trade quantities and the prices of fossil resources decrease. Regions like the Middle East with high export shares in trade of fossil resources lose revenues and hence bear the highest mitigation costs. In the discussed policy scenario, characterized by the need to achieve negative emissions, biomass technologies that can be combined with CCS are most attractive. This attractiveness is enhanced by allowing regions to generate additional tradable permits by negative emissions. Regions such as Russia with a high share of global biomass resources can significantly benefit from this. Due to terms-of-trade effects, in particular an increase of the international carbon price, this holds even under the assumption that only a low amount of available biomass can be transformed into energy. The interplay between biomass technologies and carbon trading highlights the interaction of technological developments and trade effects in mitigation costs assessments. Future research priorities may be to expand the scope of the interactions represented in the model by allowing for trade in secondary energy, especially electricity, by further broadening the technology portfolio (use of electricity in the transport sector), and by taking trade barriers into account.",342.50904

Such an outcome indicates the complex linkages between the potential for using advanced energy technologies and changes in international markets. In the Biomass_low scenario, Russia cannot of course use as much biomass as in the 400ppm scenario, and hence fewer permits can be sold. However, the increase in the permit price more than compensates this quantity reduction. By 2050, the permit price rises to $US 120 per tCO2 in the 400ppm scenario and up to $US 550 per tCO2 in the Biomass_low scenario. In the latter, regional mitigation costs differ greatly. In addition to Russia, LAM and Africa face high negative costs. In all other regions, except ROW, mitigation costs increase substantially compared with the 400ppm scenario. The Biomass_low scenario does not only affect the permit market but also the resource markets. With the lower biomass potential, and therefore lower potential for emissions reduction, less fossil resources can be employed and fuels consumed. The decrease in demand accelerates the decline of exports and imports in fossil resources, and their terms of trade with the composite good fall (see Figure 15). These price and quantity effects provide a compelling picture of the interlinked impacts on mitigation costs of technology options and trade. Within the CCSmin scenario oil prices are somewhat higher than in the Biomass_low scenario, but coal prices decline even further (see Figure 15). Overall, the impact of the CCSmin scenario is in the same direction as that of the Biomass_low scenario but more moderate.

The loss of oil-export revenues, due to the climate-policy-induced reductions in both the export volume and price of crude oil, explain part of the high mitigation costs for MEA. Figure 15 shows the price path estimated in the 400ppm scenario falling increasingly below that in the baseline scenario for both coal and oil as the century progresses. As revenues from coal and gas exports drop remarkably, why does Russia not suffer in the same way as MEA? First, long-term losses on the gas market are compensated for by short-term gains of higher present values. But more importantly, Russia can compensate for losses on the resource markets by generating additional incomes on the permit market (see Figure 12). Notably, Russia exports even more permits than it receives by allocation to the extent that tradable permits can be generated from negative emissions linked to biomass. While this results in the globally most efficient mitigation policy, Russia benefits more than other regions as it is endowed with the largest biomass potential. On a somewhat lower level the same line of argumentation also applies to Latin America (LAM)9.",324.10364

We address these questions by investigating trade-related impacts and their relationship to domestic mitigation efforts based on available technology options. As shown in Figure 11, estimated future differences in regional mitigation costs are huge. (Sub-Saharan) Africa and MEA are the most affected regions in terms of mitigation costs which range from -12% to +8%, respectively. Africa gains from climate policy. This is due mainly to the design of the international emissions trading scheme, in particular the permit-allocation rule. However, for all regions except Africa and and to some extent Russia and India, the allocation regime has only a moderate impact on the mitigation costs (see also Leimbach et al., 2009). A detailed decomposition of mitigation costs is provided by Lueken et al. (2009). The evolution of the carbon market as represented by the flow of emission permits in Figure 12 shows Africa to be a major exporter for the rest of this century, while the USA, Europe, and MEA are major permit importers. As domestic mitigation efforts become increasingly more expensive in the importing regions, emissions trading helps them contain mitigation costs. Nevertheless, all three major importing regions face costs above the world average. This also applies to India, which becomes a buyer of emission permits in the second half of the century, while China switches from being a large buyer in the first half to a minor seller in the closing decades of the century. These observed developments in permit-trade patterns arise from growth assumptions. India is assumed to experience economic growth at higher rates than China in the medium-term and long-term. Contraction of globally available emission permits in this time span hits India harder than China. Even if expenditures on the permit market charge the budget of MEA more than that of the more developed economies of Europe and the USA, this cannot be the only reason for the extremely high mitigation costs for MEA. Other production-related and trade-related impacts play an important role as well. We therefore proceed from trade in permits to trade in primary energy products and its connection with domestic output and demand. Figure 13 shows domestic output and consumption, exports and imports of four such products for the baseline scenario. A similar pattern can also be seen in the 400ppm scenario. It transpires that the energy market is characterized by a high degree of specialization. Only a few regions (mainly MEA, Russia and ROW) supply the international market with primary energy carriers. In many other regions, imported primary energy makes up more than 50% of domestic consumption of coal, oil and gas. MEA’s specialized resource endowments favor a production structure based on fossil fuels. Regardless of the high export shares, the consumption of fossil fuels in",324.52763

This produces additional emissions which are compensated for by decreasing the use of oil and coal (i.e. coal to liquids) in the transport sector. There is no carbon-free substitute in the transport sector, as biomass is already used to its maximum potential. Hence, the supply of energy for use in the transport sector is reduced. But such a cut also applies to the electricity sector. Whereas all other scenarios can contain the loss of electricity production, the Noall_butrenew scenario reacts to the elimination of technology options with a drastic reduction in electricity production (see Figure 10d). Especially in that latter scenario, energy becomes quite expensive.

The major part of this difference is due to different amounts of carbon capturing linked to the burning of fossil fuels. Only a minor part of the gap arises from differences in the biomass potential. In all scenarios, the respective maximum potential of biomass is employed and mostly combined with CCS. Biomass is mainly used in the transport sector but hardly at all in the electricity sector (cf. Figure 10). In the 400ppm scenario, coal is captured in the second half of the century by up to 4 GtC p.a.. Without the availability of nuclear technologies and learning, this capture rises to more than 9 GtC p.a. as reduced consumption of nuclear energy is compensated for mostly by increased consumption of coal whose associated emissions need to be captured (see Figure 9b, dark grey line, and Figure 10b, Coal, CCS). The missing learning effect reduces the incentive of switching to renewable technologies, with solar technologies being entirely displaced. In contrast, with a low biomass potential (see Figure 9c and Figure 10c), there is no substitution by coal combined with CCS. In fact the opposite occurs; coal consumption combined with CCS is reduced drastically. This steep drop in fossil-based CCS is due to the need to avoid the remaining emissions from this technology which in the Biomass_low scenario can to a lesser extent be compensated for by negative emissions from the biomass & CCS option.",342.08045

The advanced industrial countries reduce their annual per capita emissions from 3-6 tC in 2005 to approximately 2 tC by 2050 and then further to 1 tC by 2100. There is hardly any increase in per capita emissions in the developing regions of the world. Except for MEA, all these regions emit less than 1 tC per capita p.a. throughout the century. Africa, Russia and LAM start to have negative emissions by 2040. Russian emissions are most striking, continuing to reduce to a per capita level of -8 tC p.a. by 2100. This is the result of Russia’s high biomass potential being used in combination with CCS. Such pronounced differences in per capita emissions do not derive from the permit allocation scheme that may incorporate norms of international equity. Given the free flow of permits and the possibility of trading virtual permits that are generated by negative emissions, the separability of efficiency and equity hold (cf. Manne and Stephan, 2005). This results in the same regional development of the energy system and the emission trajectories irrespective of the permit allocation. Figure 7 shows the evolution of global mitigation costs in the 400ppm scenario, measured as consumption losses relative to the baseline scenario.

We consider two reference scenarios: a reference business-as-usual scenario and a reference climate policy scenario. In the following, the former is referred to as baseline scenario and the latter as 400ppm scenario. The policy scenario achieves climate stabilization but without constraining the set of available technologies. In the next section, alternative constraints on the technology options available then generate different technology scenarios. In the baseline scenario, we simulate a development as if climate change had no economically or socially important effects. The 400ppm scenario, by contrast, takes account of climate policies designed to reduce climate change and its impacts. The control instrument is a cap on energy-related CO2 emissions that is to stabilize the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases at around 400ppm CO2eq by 2150. Notably, this emission cap requires negative energy-related CO2 emissions at the end of the century. Van Vuuren et al. (2007) provide more details of this low stabilization scenario with respect to the exogenously given reduction of non-CO2 greenhouse gases and land-use change emissions. Both follow optimistic assumptions on the reduction potential and costs. The 400ppm scenario includes an international emissions trading system based on a contraction & convergence rule of permit allocation. This rule implies a transition from status-quo allocation towards an equal per capita permit allocation until 2050. A co-operative policy regime is assumed where all regions begin emissions mitigation immediately. While this is idealistic, it provides an important point of reference. Both reference scenarios are based on common assumptions on population growth and economic growth as given by the ADAM baseline scenario (see Edenhofer et al., 2010). Global population stabilizes at around 9 billion in the middle of the century. Africa is the region with highest growth and highest population (around 2.1 billion) in 2100. Economic growth by region was projected from 2005 to 2100 as shown in Figure 3. This projection involved exogenous adjustment of efficiency growth parameters of the production factors. World-wide GDP of about 42 trillion $US3 in 2005 increases to almost $US 345 trillion in 2100. While China already provides a significant share of global GDP in the coming decades, its growth rate of 1.5% in 2100 is comparatively low; India’s growth rate, for example, is 2.7%. The highly developed regions—USA, Europe, Japan—exhibit the lowest growth rates (less than 1% by 2100). They lose share in global GDP but still account for one-third of world GDP by 2100. Per capita GDP levels between regions converge rather slowly. In particular, Africa’s per capita GDP in 2100 is more than 80% below the world level of $US 38,000. Figure 4 shows how the baseline and the 400ppm scenarios differ with regard to the energy system’s development. Primary energy consumption  increases continuously from around 475 EJ p.a. in 2005 to more than 1100 EJ p.a. in 2100 in the baseline scenario and to almost 920 EJ p.a. in the 400ppm scenario. While consumption of fossil resources is significantly reduced in the 400ppm scenario, part of this reduction is made up by greater reliance on biomass, wind and nuclear energy in the short to medium term. In the long run, the 400ppm scenario is distinguished from the baseline scenario primarily by the use of solar energy and the use of coal in conjunction with CCS.",342.04843

The technical transformation coefficients for new vintages are the same for all regions and assumed to be constant. However, the following modifications apply: the transformation efficiency is improved over time for fossil power generation technologies and different technology grades are considered when renewable energy sources are used. Electricity is the secondary energy carrier that can be produced from all primary energy carriers, and the use of fossil-fueled power stations could be augmented by CCS. However, the option of biomass power production with CCS as well as the use of electricity in the transport sector are not included in the model. Transport fuels, hydrogen and gases can either be produced from fossil energy carriers or biomass. The production of transport fuels and hydrogen could also be equipped with CCS – both for fossil-fueled and biomass-fueled facilities. The capture rate for the liquid transportation fuels is considerably lower than for hydrogen and electricity. Note that the investment costs for both biomass technologies (B2H2 and B2L) with and without CCS are quite high. The model considers that captured CO2 needs to be transported and compressed prior to injection. Storage is assumed to be in geological formations only. There is leakage in the process of capturing, but no leakage from sequestered CO2. Space in geological formations is generously measured for all regions.

The learning rate are assumed to be 10% and 20%, respectively (see e.g. Neij et al., 2003; Junginger et al., 2005; McDonald and Schrattenholzer, 2001). Investment costs can be reduced to the floor cost limit of 700 $US per kW for wind and 1000 $US per kW for solar PV. The effect of learning is limited to a region; no spillovers are considered. The initially installed capacities and the initial investment costs vary by region. However, cost differences are small. On average, initial investment costs for wind and solar PV technologies amount to 1100 $US per kW and 4500 $US per kW, respectively. Regarding nuclear power the model only considers Light Water Reactors; their investment costs, here assumed to be 2500 $US per kW, are highly uncertain. Adverse side-effects regarding nuclear proliferation, dismantling, waste treatment, and safety are not considered. In general, the model imposes no restrictions on growth rates, or on shares in the energy mix, of any energy sources or technologies. Hence it is flexible in technology choice and maintains capital-market equilibrium for all technologies. Only one exogenous restriction is imposed in REMIND-R: For nuclear power plants, the increase of investment costs is tied to capacity expansion. A critical capacity level is set that starts at 5 GW globally in 2005 and increases by 1 GW each year. Exceeding its trend value by 10% is assumed to increase investment costs by 5%.",342.1113

Harvest costs of biomass increase from 1.4 to 5.6 $US per GJ between lowest and highest grade. The production potential of biomass summed over all grades is assumed to increase up to around 200 EJ p.a. until 2050 (cf. Grahn et al. 2007). Regional shares, which are kept constant, follow Hoogwijk (2004). Bio-energy production is based on the use of ligno-cellulosic biomass and associated emissions from land-use change and management are ignored. For renewables other than biomass the grades differ in the availability factor. The two most important renewables are wind and solar. These have global potentials of at most 140 EJ and 750 EJ, with maximum availability factors of 31% and 25%, respectively (see e.g. Hoogwijk, 2004; WBGU, 2003). Secondary energy carriers are assumed to be non-tradable across regions even though small amounts of liquid fuels are, in fact, traded internationally. Since the REMIND-R model treats crude oil as tradable, the omission bias is limited. Secondary energy carriers are converted into final energy carriers by considering mark-ups for transmission and distribution. Final energy is demanded by the macroeconomic sector at equilibrium prices. We now turn to the most important features of the conversion technologies, all of which are employable in the model. The possibility of investing in different capital stocks provides, on the one hand, a high flexibility of technological evolution. On the other hand, low depreciation rates and long life times of energy production capacities cause inertia. Key techno-economic assumptions of selected technologies are summarized in Table 3.",324.50618

It is embedded in the macro-economy module where the techno-economic characteristics and the system of balance equations that underlie the energy system are constraints on the welfare-maximization problem. The energy system can be considered as an economic sector with a heterogenous capital stock that demands primary energy carriers and supplies final energy carriers. The structure of the capital stock determines the energy related demand-supply structure. The sector takes financing from the capital market which is allocated among a portfolio of alternative energy conversion technologies. The techno-economic characteristics of the technologies and the endogenously evolving prices of energy and CO2 emissions determine the size and structure of the energy sector’s capital stock. Hence, the energy sector develops in moving equilibrium to the remaining economy with which it is interrelated through capital and energy markets. The availability of technologies for the conversion of primary into final energy carriers is essential for the valuation of the primary energy carriers. In the multiregional setting, the regions’ valuation of primary energy endowments is influenced by international trade opportunities. Depending on available technologies, climate change mitigation policies and induced changes in trade patterns lead to a revaluation of these endowments. This interplay has significant impact on the regional and global mitigation costs. Table 1 presents the primary energy carriers by column and the secondary energy carriers by row. The conversion technologies indicate possible methods for converting primary into secondary energy carriers. The primary energy carriers rely on both exhaustible and renewable energy sources. The exhaustible energy carriers—coal, oil, gas, and uranium—are tradable and characterized by extraction cost functions. These functions are based on the assumption that resources are exploited in an optimal sequence. This implies that the cheapest deposits are exploited first and the marginal costs of discovering and developing new reserves are increasing. The result is a function in which marginal extraction costs rise with the cumulative amount of extraction. Figure 2 shows the reserve endowments of exhaustible primary energy carriers. In contrast to the other three energy carriers, coal is abundant and widely available. However, Japan has hardly any fossil resources, and regions with the largest populations, especially China and India, have only relatively small endowments. The USA, Russia and ROW are well endowed, especially with coal, and their population shares are modest.",324.05026

Nordhaus and Yang, 1996; Manne and Rutherford, 1994; Leimbach and Toth, 2003). Within this iterative approach, Negishi weights are adjusted so that for each region the net present value of trade is zero. The trade pattern in the model is governed by this intertemporal budget constraint which balances trade across all goods over the entire time horizon. A current net export of the composite good, lowering domestic consumption, is matched by a future net import of any good of the same present value during the simulation period with a reverse effect on consumption. Trade with emission permits works in a similar way. The sale of emission rights generates a surplus in the current account that has to be balanced by future imports of permits or goods. We do not restrict trade flows by artificial bounds. In the intertemporal model framework, where productivity differences between regions are equalized by capital trade (i.e., trade in the composite good), this leads to initial spikes in current account balances and an overestimation of trade flows (cf. Nordhaus and Yang, 1996). As this temporary distortion applies equally to the baseline and policy scenarios, meaningful comparative results can still be obtained. Intertemporal trade (and therefore the possibility of current account deficits) in REMIND-R significantly contributes to the growth dynamics of the world economy, which is in accordance with empirical and theoretical findings from the literature. Its isolated impact on the mitigation costs, however, is moderate.",341.96369

A global welfare function, which is maximized by a social planner, is formed as a weighted sum of the regional utility functions. For climate-policy simulations, a climate policy target is entered into the model as an additional constraint, and REMIND-R is then run to determine the most cost-effective mode of achieving that target. Macroeconomic output, i.e. gross domestic product (GDP), is determined by a “constant elasticity of substitution” (CES) function of the production factors labor, capital and final energy. The substitution elasticity assumed between these factors is 0.5. The final energy of the upper production level is calculated with an aggregator function comprising transportation energy and stationary-use energy. Both are connected by a substitution elasticity of 0.3. These two energy types in turn are determined by means of nested CES functions of more specific final energy types. Substitution elasticities between 2.5 and 3 hold for the lower levels of the CES nest. An efficiency parameter is assigned to each production factor in the various macroeconomic CES functions. Changes in the efficiency of the individual production factors are given by exogenous scenarios. While we assume a constant efficiency of capital, labor productivity growth is adjusted to reproduce the regional GDP baselines as harmonized within the ADAM model comparison. Efficiency growth of the different final energy types is in type-specific constant relation to changes of labor productivity. GDP, denoted Y(t,r), is used for private and government non-energy consumption C(t,r), non-energy gross investments I(t,r), all expenditures in the energy system, and export of the composite good XG(t,r).

Yet, as discussed in Edenhofer et al. (2010), only a few mitigation-policy studies have analyzed the feasibility and costs of very low stabilization scenarios. We add to these few analyses and extend the scope of mitigation-cost assessments by focusing on the joint impact of technological change in the energy sector and international trade. Based on the very low climate stabilization target (400ppm CO2eq) adopted by the ADAM model comparison, this paper aims to identify the magnitude of the aggregate mitigation costs of attaining such a target and to answer the question on how costs vary by technology and region. A majority of climate policy studies consider the energy sector as the key sector for mitigation strategies. Indeed, the transformation of the global energy system appears to be a promising and effective way of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Having a portfolio of different technology options is crucial for transforming the energy system, and such options are well represented in bottom-up models. However, technological change in the energy sector is embedded in a microeconomic and macroeconomic environment (as represented by top-down models) where, directed by relative-price, profit, and scale-of-market expectations, investment decisions are made. Few models formally integrate macroeconomic-system and detailed energy-system modules. Hybrid models bridge the gap between conventional top-down and bottom-up modeling approaches (Hourcade et al., 2006), making them the preferred tool for mitigation policy assessments. We discuss the contribution of technological options in containing the costs of climate change mitigation based on such a model—REMIND-R. The dynamic energy-economy-environment model REMIND-R links technological development of the energy system to the domestic capital market and to international markets. This makes mitigation costs a function of international trade decisions, a dependence that has been neglected in the literature including the Fourth Assessment Report of the IPCC (2007). Moreover, the IPCC Report and most studies of low stabilization scenarios (e.g., Azar et al., 2006; den Elzen et al., 2007; Edenhofer et al., 2006; van Vuuren et al., 2007) consider global mitigation costs only. This paper helps to fill this gap by providing estimates of the regional distribution of mitigation costs in a world economy where regions are linked by global markets for emission permits, goods, and energy resources. In many energy-economy-climate models, trade in emission permits is the only recognized element of international trade. Such models do not lend themselves to discovering opportunities for improving welfare through reallocation of capital or of mitigation efforts over regions and time. In contrast to such a model design, REMIND-R derives a benchmark for a first-best intertemporal optimum in all markets. From simulation results, it transpires firstly that deep cuts in emissions— and even negative global emissions from 2075 on—are possible. Second, the loss of consumption need not exceed 2% globally in any period if a broad portfolio of technological options is available; this result is conditional on the assumption of a constant relationship between efficiency improvements in the production factors labor and final energy. Third, carbon capturing and sequestration (CCS) will play a major role in combination with both fossil fuels and biomass; when biomass has a limited potential to contribute to negative emissions, costs will be very much higher. Fourth, regional mitigation costs differ significantly as terms-of-trade effects have a major impact; through a decrease in demand for coal and oil, exporting regions such as Middle East and Russia will suffer from reduced trade revenues. Fifth, by cap, trade and convergence, Africa and Russia can make substantial gains from emissions trading; trade effects on the energy and carbon market vary with the availability of technological options. This paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents some details of the model REMIND-R, including important assumptions and empirical foundations. Results from REMIND-R simulations for a reference business-as-usual scenario and a reference climate policy scenario are given in Section 3. The analysis of technology scenarios in Section 4 provides insights into the energy-system dynamics that set the basis for the cost estimates. Cost-relevant changes in trade patterns and the interlinked impact of technology options and trade are highlighted in Section 5, and Section 6 concludes on the results.",324.03772

It is our view that analyzing alternative climate targets via independent deterministic model runs is not as satisfactory an approach as explicitly acknowledging the uncertainties underlying the choice of alternate targets, and then tackling these via appropriate tools. In particular, the approach via stochastic programming, although simplified, has the merit of producing a single hedging policy when facing major uncertainties, and thus remedying the main defect of traditional scenario analysis. The hedging strategy was itself shown not to be a naïve average ofdeterministic ones, and to present a mix of abatement actions that could not easily be found otherwise.

Overall, the hedging strategy presents a smoother transition from the initial electricity mix to a radically different one in 2040, than the 3.7 or the 2.6 strategies. It shows a more gradual decline of conventional coal plants and a more gradual increase ofCCS technologies. This ‘smoothing’ property is often observed in hedging solutions (Labriet et al., 2009), and is easier to implement in practice. In particular, it tells us that the CCS technology in electricity plants should be fully commercialized by 2020–25, whereas the 2.6OS (resp. 3.7OS) deterministic strategy recommends 2015 (resp. 2035) for that technology.",251.110654

This conformation is however approximate since the distribution is not precisely known. This observation is in itself interesting, as it indicates that when alternate targets are selected for separate analysis, some care should be taken to select them in a way that represents a fair sample of the possible consequences of these targets. Such consequences include temperature change, but beyond that, they ultimately aim at evaluating damages caused by the various emission trajectories.

The main benefit of hedging lies precisely in revealing a single set of hedging actions during the uncertainty period. Therefore, we focus our brief analysis of results on that time span only, and we compare them with those of the corresponding deterministic strategies for the same three targets. What happens beyond 2040 in the stochastic programming solution is of course interesting too, but less so than the hedging actions up to 2040, which are the focus of the Transitional Policies Work Group of EMF-22. It is fair to say that our discussion of the stochastic programming results remains sketchy, our main purpose being to provide a set of demonstration results to illustrate the added benefits of the method, but leaving a full discussion and use of the approach for future work.

It seemed interesting and useful to attempt an alternative interpretation of the targets, by examining them simultaneously, as the manifestation of a single temperature target, subject to alternate outcomes of a random variable, the Climate Sensitivity parameter Cs. To illustrate and test this approach, we selected the First Best scenario and the three alternate RF targets with overshoot, and we sought the single temperature target (if such exists) that is equivalent to them. By examining the RF trajectories issued from the 3 separate scenario runs, we discovered that the 2.45 °C target on temperature increase fulfills this condition, as long as we assume specific values for the climate sensitivity parameter Cs. We were therefore able to replace the three alternate RF targets by that single temperature target, while acknowledging the randomness of Cs. The detailed procedure is as follows: The first task before us was to calculate the temperature changes resulting from each of the three RF trajectories obtained from the three separate scenario runs. To do so, we first added to the RF trajectories, the extra forcing due to non-Kyoto substances, in order to obtain the trajectories of Total Radiative Forcing (noted TRF) over the 21st century. The non-Kyoto forcings (Montréal gases, aerosol effects (direct and indirect), dust, water vapor, OH− radical, ozone, solar and volcanic activity) were estimated from the 2005 inventory of IPCC (2007, vol. 1), and from their likely future evolutions as discussed in part in IPCC (2007) and in Prinn et al. (2008). These additional forcing terms were assumed to remain the same for all scenarios and all values of Cs. The three TRF trajectories thus obtained were then injected into TIAM's global temperature change equations mentioned in Section 2.1, in order to obtain the 3 trajectories for temperature change, while assuming a different valuefor Cs in each case. After some trial-and-error search, we found that when choosing the respective values Cs=2 °C, Cs=2.9 °C, Cs=5 °C, the temperature equations yielded the same maximum temperature change of 2.45 °C, as illustrated in Fig. 10. In order to calculate the temperature change beyond the model's horizon (2100), we made the assumption that GHG emissions decline linearly to 0 over a 300 year period, i.e. from 2100 to 2400 (we also verified that changing this period to 200 years or to 400 years made very little difference in the peak temperature change). We then verified that the three selected Cs values were indeed compatible with a simplified — but valid, discrete approximation of the continuous probability distributions of Cs. Such a distribution is reported in IPCC (2007 vol.1, chapter 2), and a similar one from Andronova and Schlesinger (2001) is shown in Fig. 2. Our three Cs values are a valid (albeit crude) discrete approximation ofthe continuous distribution of Fig. 11 as long as we choose their respective probabilities of occurrence equal to 0.50, 0.35, and 0.15, as also shown in Fig. 11. Note that, in a distinct Hedging Workgroup of EMF-22, a similar probability distribution for Cs was recommended, with four discrete values rather than three (Yohe et al., 2004; Labriet et al., 2009, for details on the EMF-22 Hedging scenarios). We do not claim that our 3-point probability distribution is a very accurate approximation of the continuous distribution, but we have indeed statistically verified that our approximation was a valid one among the set ofall 3-point discrete approximations. Note however that our simplistic 3-point approximation neglects the possibility of very large Cs values, which may yet occur with non negligible probability, as the right tail of the distribution of Fig. 11 shows. Labriet et al. (2009) used stochastic programming in a situation when Cs may have values up to 8 °C. We are now in a position to consider the single Temperature change target of 2.45 °C with random Cs, as long as we choose the Cs values and probabilities mentioned above. The logical step following this is to use the stochastic programming (Wets, 1989) version of the TIAM partial equilibrium, where the Forcing limit is now explicitly modeled as a random variable with the probability distribution of Fig. 11. One more assumption is needed, namely the choice of the date of resolution of the uncertainty on Cs. We are well aware that the date of resolution of uncertainty on Cs is subject to intense debate. While all climate scientists agree that uncertainty will endure for several decades, some argue in favor of a more radical view of the phenomenon, stating that Cs will remain uncertain for a very long time, and perhaps forever (Weitzman, 2008). In this article, we adhere to the middle-of-the-road resolution date of 2040, in accordance with the recommendation of the EMF-22 Hedging Workgroup (Yohe et al., 2004; Labriet et al., 2009).",251.1024

The full graphs are shown in the Appendix. 3.6.1. Transportation This sector undergoes major changes when climate targets are imposed. The main (expected) fuel switch is away from oil based fuels, which are, roughly speaking replaced by alcohols and biodiesel. This switch is most pronounced in scenarios with the 2.6 forcing target. In addition, electric (and plug-in hybrid) vehicles increase their market share several fold, but electricity still stays below 10% of the total energy of the sector, in all cases (however, given the larger efficiency of electric motors, this represents about 16–18% of the transportation service demand). Hydrogen fuel-cell heavy vehicles and hydrogen fueled planes consume together around 12% of the sector's energy in the most severe climate cases, using hydrogen that is predominantly produced from low emitting sources, as already mentioned. Gas market share grows to around 12–15% by mid-century, but then declines to 0 in 2100, except in REF and in the scenarios with a 4.5 target. In all others, gas disappears as a transportation fuel by 2100. Gas is used mainly by light duty vehicles for urban travel. Note that energy savings in the transportation sector are relatively insensitive to the climate scenarios, for two reasons: first, many energy savings are embedded in the vintage vehicles of the TIAM database, and thus already appear in the REF scenario. The second reason is that alcohol fueled vehicles are not more efficient than oil fueled ones. The only case where overall final energy shows a marked decrease is the 2B-2.6OS scenario toward the end of the century, because alcohol's share is then small, replaced by more electricity and hydrogen. 3.6.2. Industry The most remarkable result in this sector is the sharp penetration of electricity and/or gas in most climate scenarios, and a corresponding decline of coal. Coal never totally disappears but its residual share is reserved for dedicated uses in metallurgy. Electricity penetration is highest in scenarios with a 2.6 target, reaching up to 70% of the sector energy. In less severe climate scenarios, electricity and gas have about equal shares. Both these fuels are used massively to produce heat and steam in efficient furnaces and boilers. In addition, some of the metallic industries are converted to electrometallurgy. Biomass use does increase in percentage of the total, but remains largely confined to the production ofheat and steam in the pulp and paper industry. Oil keeps a fairly steady share, mostly because it is used for petrochemicals and other non-energy uses. Finally, Industry shows the largest percentage of final energy savings, but of course this is largely the consequence of electricity penetration, with its very high efficiency (thus, here too, one should be careful in assessing the meaning and importance of energy savings). 3.6.3. Buildings Additional energy savings are modest, but this is because most insulation and other energy conserving measures are already adopted as no-regret actions in the Reference scenario. In policy scenarios, oil declines progressively to 0, gas maintains a small market share, and electricity increases somewhat its already large market share (more so in scenarios with the 2.6 target).

Additional detailed results are shown in the Appendix. 3.5.1. Alcohols The main results are shown in Fig. 8 for some representative scenarios. Of all “new” secondary fuels, alcohol is the one showing the largest increase due to policy scenarios. The figure shows, in the REF scenario, a stabilized production of 21 EJ/yr after 2050 (all from coal and gas sources, with emission of CO2), whereas the levels are much higher for the policy scenarios, growing to 40 EJ, 80 EJ, and more than 100 EJ, respectively for the 4.5, 3.7, and 2.6 targets, the growth occurring very soon for the 2.6 target, and mostly after 2050 for the other two targets. Only a small portion of alcohol produced in the climate scenarios emits full CO2, the majority being produced with CCS (and thus low emissions), from cellulosic biomass, from sugar crops, or from coal. We use the phrase “low emitting” since there are small amounts of CO2 emitted when using CCS. In the 2B-2p6OS scenario, there is a decline ofalcohol use from 2070 to 2100, due to the competing use ofbiomass and ofstorage sinks by the electricity sector. 3.5.2. Synthetic fuels Our model includes technologies for producing fuel oil, diesel, and kerosene from coal, with or without CO2 capture. Note however that (just like in the case ofalcohols produced from coal with CCS), the CO2 thus captured is only the CO2 that would be emitted at the production stage. For this reason, this option is little used in the Policy scenario, whereas it is much used in the REF scenario. Details on the production of synthetic fuels appear in the Appendix. 3.5.3. Hydrogen As shown in Fig. 9, hydrogen production is stimulated by the Policy scenarios, especially in the second half of the century. In REF, the production is only from coal without CCS, and peaks at 25 EJ (still a non negligible amount). With the milder 4.5 target, there is still a good amount of production with full CO2 emission, but this is no longer the case for the scenarios with 3.7 or 2.6 target, where the quasi totality of the (much increased) production is either from biomass or from coal with CCS. Hydrogen thus plays a less prominent role than alcohols in the policy scenarios, but one that is far from negligible, capturing around 4% of total world energy from 2050 on.",251.134585

In Industry, the climate target has a more profound impact: from 2050 on, electricity use is little affected by the 3.7 and 4.5 targets, but multiplied by 3 to 4 for the 2.6 target. The increase occurs in the supply ofheat and steam (electric boilers) but also in the use of electrometallurgy for steel and non ferrous metal production. In transportation, electric vehicles appear around 2040–2050. Compared to REF, electricity use is multiplied by 1.5 to 2 for the 3.7 and 4.5 targets in 2050, rising to 3-fold in 2100. For the 2.6 target, use ofelectricity is three times that ofREF in 2050, rising to 5 times in 2100. However high may these increases appear, they remain relatively modest as percentages of total transportation fuels, as will be discussed further down. The use ofelectricity for fuel production shows a sharp decline relative to its REF levels. This is directly due to the decline ofoil and gas production and refining (which require electricity).

The dominant new technology depends on the target: with both the 3.7 and the 2.6 targets, coal+CCS and biomass+CCS penetrate strongly. However, with the more stringent 2.6 target, there is not enough storage potential in some regions to satisfy the much larger electricity demand, and thus Renewables (essentially solar thermal and wind) come in very strongly. Still with the 2.6 target, gas plants+CCS appear around 2030–2040 in those regions where biomass is not abundant, but gas is.

Fig. 6a shows the primary energy consumption, using a conventional efficiency of 1 for nuclear and renewables, biomass excepted. We observe that as the climate constraint becomes more severe, total consumption of primary energy increases (in spite of the conventional accounting assumption). Fig. 6c shows a global increase in electricity production when the climate target is more severe, and Fig. 6b (primary energy with CCS ) indicates that carbon capture and storage increases when the target is more severe. These three results must be analyzed simultaneously: the implementation of CCS occurs mostly in the electricity generation sector (plus some in hydrogen production and oil extraction), and the key power plants with CCS are coal or biomass fired. Coal is chosen because ofits low cost in many regions, and biomass because, when associated with CCS, these plants in effect produce negative amounts of CO2, a very useful recourse when CO2 emissions approach or reach zero level. Gas plants plus CCS are marginally used, and only in regions with abundant gas and/or costlier access to coal and biomass, such as Africa and the Middle-East. Hence, producing more electricity is a way to capture and store more CO2. Now, to explain the larger total primary energy consumption in the severe climate cases, two factors come into play: the first is that wood and coal fired plants with CCS have lower efficiencies than gas fired or ordinary coal fired plants, explaining the results shown in Fig. 6a. The second factor is precisely the larger role ofelectricity in severe climate cases: the way to increase electricity use is to adopt electric devices to substitute fossil fuel fired end-use technologies, mostly boilers, furnaces, and some industrial processes. But since the overall efficiency of electric devices (i.e. the ratio energy service over primary energy used) is in many instances worse than that of end-use processes that use fuels directly, this climate driven choice results in an increase of total primary energy consumption. As an example, a typical gas furnace may have an efficiency exceeding 85–90%, whereas an electric furnace's overall efficiency is much lower than that — at best 50%, when electricity is produced by a coal or biomass fired power plant with CCS, which is a dominant way to produce electricity in climate scenarios. This explanation does not hold for electric vehicles for instance, but electric vehicles are not massively adopted by the model.",251.111487

One example is the Kyoto reductions agreed upon by most Annex I countries, another one is the European Union decision to reach a 20% emission reduction in 2020, with respect to 1990 level. The five First Best scenario cases consist in setting constraints on Radiative Forcing from Kyoto gases (noted RF), either in 2100 (overshoot cases) or at each period from 2010 to 2100 (max cases). In addition, we have imposed that the First Best solution must agree with the Reference scenario solution from 2005 to 2009, in order to prevent the model from ‘optimizing the past’. The Second Best scenario is more complex to simulate in a model such as ETSAP-TIAM. The first condition of scenario 2 is that country group 2 (respectively group 3) is absent from the climate coalition until 2030 (resp. 2050). This is done in ETSAP-TIAM, by selectively ‘freezing’ the emissions at the levels obtained in the Reference scenario until those dates. However, since the climate scenarios have an impact even on regions not in the coalition (for instance via the change in imports and exports of energy), we also conducted a check on the total forcing and verified that the targets were not exceeded. The precise procedure is described in the electronic Appendix. The second condition of scenario 2 specifies that when groups 2 and 3 enter the coalition (in 2030 and 2050 respectively), they do so by initially limiting their GHG reductions to those whose cost per ton is less that the cost per ton of group 1 that prevailed in 2012. Later, each group increases its threshold GHG price, reaching the full coalition price 20 years after the entry date. This condition is more difficult to simulate with TIAM because the model does not have a direct, explicit handle on prices. Therefore, an iterative, trial-and-error approach is used, also described in the Appendix. 3.1.1. Global cost The cost concept in ETSAP-TIAM is expressed as the loss of total surplus. Comparing the surplus losses (relative to REF) resulting from various policies is a convenient and compact way of globally comparing the relative severities of the scenarios-targets combinations. Table 2 shows the net present value in 2005 of the stream of global surplus losses, whereas Fig. 3 shows the 9 global surplus losses, expressed as percentages of global GDP at each period. The table clearly shows the vast discrepancy in cost between the 2.6 target and the others. It also shows that the 4.5 target can be considered as mild in terms of global costs. Finally, the NPV's show that there are significant differences in costs between the First Best and the Second Best cases with same target. In contrast, the cost differences between MAX and OS cases with the 3.7 target are quite small. The more detailed annual costs of Fig. 3 show that the 2.6 W/m2 target is exceedingly costly to attain, even in the early years of the century. As expected, the cases using the 4.5 W/m2 target (the 2 bottom lines in Fig. 3) are achieved at relatively low global cost (less than 1% of GDP throughout the century), and the costs of the four cases with the 3.7 target (the four solid lines) stay below 1% of GDP until 2050, and then under 2% of GDP for most of the second half of the century. For completeness, we are also showing the regional losses ofsurplus in Table 3, and the losses by individual countries in the Appendix. These surplus losses are based on the assumption that “who acts” is also “who pays”, i.e. that there are no permits traded. Our discussion ofthe regional losses is very succinct, because it is based on a rather artificial assumption regarding initial emission rights endowments. A more in-depth discussion would require us to define precise — and acceptable, assumptions on the allocation of emission rights to each region, a very interesting subject in its own right, but one that would deserve a detailed analysis that is not possible within the limits of this article. Our own simplistic assumption amounts to auctioning all emission rights, with the result that no emission trading takes place, and such a scheme seems unrealistic in an international situation. Be that as it may, we may still notice that group 1 costs are very low, and often negative, due to the fact that a good portion of the reductions occur in other regions, but also to the fact that group 1's cost for importing fossil fuels is much reduced in the second best scenario. Group 2 costs on the contrary are very large, since that group bears the brunt ofemissions reductions. Finally group 3 costs are also large, but for a different reason: in Policy scenarios, consumption (and production) of oil and gas are much reduced, thus penalizing this group 3, which includes large oil and gas exporters. Finally, we observe from Fig. 1 that the global cost trajectory of each First Best case is not much different from that of the corresponding second best case, (except for the 2.6 target with overshoot). We shall return to this observation in Subsection 3.2. 3.1.2. GHG prices GHG price (expressed in dollars per ton of CO2-equivalent), is another useful indicator of the ease or difficulty of a scenario. In Fig. 2, the GHG prices of the five targets without overshoot, are shown at each period for group 1, confirming that the 2.6 W/m2 target is indeed hard to satisfy, whereas the 4.5 W/m2 one is quite mild. The second best cases exhibit a price trajectory that is initially higher than that of the corresponding First Best case, due to the delayed participation of groups 2 and 3 which forces group 1 to implement actions that are quite costlier. Later on, the reverse is observed, and the Second Best price is lower than the First Best price, because groups 2 and 3 have by now more potential for cheap actions, since they have not yet expended them, due to their late entry. The observed downturn of the GHG price around the end ofthe century indicates that the difficulty of satisfying the targets without overshoot lies principally in the mid-century (earlier, the forcing has not yet reached levels close to the target and the economic growth has not yet made emissions large enough, while later the difficulty is less, because more and cheaper GHG abatement options are available). This behavior will be invoked again in Section 3.2, and is frequently observed for targets that are severe or very severe, but not for easy targets such as the 4.5 W/m2 one. Fig. 2 also shows that the absence of groups 2 and 3 from the coalition until 2030, considerably increases the price ofGHG for group 1, compared to the First Best scenario. This continues to be the case even after 2030, and until the full participation ofall countries in 2070. After that date, abatement options are more abundant, and allow a fast and large decrease of the price. In the second best scenario, GHG prices are region specific. Fig. 3 shows GHG prices for the 3 groups, in the 2B-3p7max case, with prices lower in groups 2 and 3 than in group 1, until full participation of the late entrants. 3.1.3. Reductions in economic activity In TIAM, the first order impact of energy decisions on economic activity is directly measured by the changes in the levels of the 42 output demand categories, which are reacting to climate policies. Assessing total economic impacts requires a general equilibrium approach. However, it has been shown with some confidence that the first order impact as estimated by partial equilibrium models captures the vast majority of total impacts on demands (Scheper and Kram, 1994; Loulou and Kanudia, 2000). In order to summarize these impacts in a compact way, we have grouped the 50 demands into four homogeneous sets: Table 4 shows the percentage reductions of demands, grouped in four main sectors (energy intensive industries, other industries, buildings, and road transport) in 2050 and in 2100, relative to the Reference scenario values for these same years, for the five MAX cases only. The most severe case is 1B-2p6max, as expected, which provokes in 2050 reductions in activity several times larger than the next most severe case, 2B-3p7max. The demand reductions are generally larger in 2100 than in 2050 (except for the 2.6max target). This may be explained by the fact that most technological options have been exhausted, forcing the model to resort to demand reductions in order to satisfy the forcing constraint (in all fairness, this may also indicate a lack of new technological options in the model's database toward the end of the century). The sector most impacted is the Industrial sector. This is in some part due to the lack of radical options for reducing emissions in that sector, at least in the model's database. The other sectors are less affected, but the demand reductions remain significant in all sectors.",251.15521

Each technology has its own technical and economic parameters. Such technological detail allows precise tracking of capital turnover, and provides a detailed description of technological competition. The model's scope covers extraction, processing, conversion, trading, and end-uses of all energy forms. Primary resources are disaggregated by type (e.g. proven vs. future natural gas reserves, connected vs. not, frontier gas, CBM, associated gas, etc). Each type ofnon renewable resource is described in each region by means ofa step-wise supply curve (3 steps) for the cumulative amounts in the ground, technical annual extraction limits, fixed and variable costs, thus constituting a many stepped supply curve for each primary energy form (coal, oil, and gas). All renewable energy forms have annual potentials in each region, also with multiple steps. ETSAP-TIAM explicitly models emissions of CO2, N2O and CH4 from all anthropic sources (energy, industry, land, agriculture, and waste), at the technology level. In addition, there are measures to destroy N2O, others to burn methane (by flaring or use in electric power plants), and still others to capture CO2 and store in underground or undersea in a variety ofreservoirs. Capture and geological storage ofCO2 is available at electric power plants, at oil wells, at plants that produce synthetic fuels, and at hydrogen plants. In each case, the capture is not complete (from 9 to 11% of the CO2 escapes to the atmosphere). Regarding N2O and CH4, only about 30–35% ofthe emissions can be destroyed or burned, the rest, mainly from the agricultural sector, have no abatement measures. The representation ofland-use CO2 emissions is quite simplified: first there is a fixed, exogenous trajectory of CO2 emissions from land use, derived from the CCSP estimates (see Prinn et al., 2008), which shows a quasi linear decline from 3.3 GtCO2 in 2010 to 0.1 GtCO2 in 2100. Then, there are biomass potentials in each region, to produce energy crops or wood. These potentials are fixed, and the model chooses to use part or all of each potential, at each model run. The degree to which the biomass potentials are (or are not) used does not affect CO2 emissions, since the biomass is emission neutral, whether harvested or not. However, if in addition, the harvested biomass is used in plants with capture and geological storage ofCO2, then the net effect is that ofnegative emissions, which we then chose to attribute to land use (perhaps a little arbitrarily). Emissions of some Kyoto gases (CFCs, HFCs, SF6) are not explicitly modeled, but a special forcing term is added as described in the next paragraph. Emissions of chemically active gases such as NOx, CO, and VOCs are not modeled either. Their influence on the life cycles of GHG gases is implicitly accounted for in the concentration equations for the three main GHG's (IPCC AR4, 2007, vol.1, ch. 2), but only through the calibration phase of the equations (Nordhaus and Boyer, 1999). The climate module per se is directly inspired by the Nordhaus and Boyer (1999) model. It consists of three sets of equations, shown in the Appendix. The first set accepts as inputs the emissions of three greenhouse gases, CO2, CH4, and N2O, from all sources (energy, industrial, land-use), net of geological capture and storage or destruction, and calculate the atmospheric concentrations of the three gases using recursive dynamic equations. The second set of equations accepts as inputs the atmospheric concentrations, calculates the atmospheric radiative forcings of these three gases, and adds them up. Then, a fourth (exogenous) forcing is added to represent the impact of Kyoto GHGs that are not explicitly modeled in TIAM (i.e. CFCs, HFCs, SF6), so as to account for the totality of the Kyoto gases when setting the forcing target. The third group of equations accepts as input the total radiative forcing, and recursively calculates the yearly change in mean global temperature in two layers (atmosphere upper ocean, and deep ocean). Heat transfer equations between these layers are represented in the equations. The transition from forcing to temperature change involves a crucial parameter, the climate sensitivity Cs, which is much uncertain. In Section 4, we indicate how this uncertainty is taken into account in this research. The model ofthe ETSAP-TIAM climate module has been compared to more sophisticated climate models and found quite accurate within the range of emissions usually considered (Nordhaus and Boyer, 1999).",251.05786

This new interpretation leads quite naturally to a probabilistic treatment ofthese three climate targets by stochastic programming, and to the computation ofa single optimal hedging strategy.

The precise conditions are outlined in detail in the capstone article of this special issue, and are summarized as follows. For each climate target, two contrasted scenarios are considered: the First Best scenario is an efficient one, assuming full cooperation of all countries toward reaching the target efficiently, starting in 2012. The Second Best scenario assumes that each group ofcountries has a different starting date for commencing its GHG mitigation actions, and furthermore that each group except group 1 will proceed in a progressive manner, starting at a low level of emission reductions, and reaching full cooperation mode 20 years after their start date. Emission trading by a group starts at the date when that group starts full cooperation. Group 1 (essentially OECD countries) starts reductions in 2012, group 2 (Brazil, India, China, Russia, the so-called BRIC's) starts in 2030 and reaches full cooperation (and trading) with group 1 in 2050, and group 3 (the rest of the World) starts reducing in 2050 and reaches full speed (and starts trading) in 2070.

As one can readily observe from the latest IPCC reports (IPCC, 2007) and from numerous other research articles on the subject, uncertainties about the future global climate abound. Some of these uncertainties are linked to the inherent randomness of climate processes — perhaps simply reflecting our lack of precise understanding of such phenomena. Others are due to the uncertain socio-economic, political, and technological developments, that will in fine determine the anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases (and other causes ofthe greenhouse effect) by different countries. In this research, we by no means claim to tackle even a small portion of the many unknowns influencing future climate changes.

Here we propose an idealized Tier 2 experiment (Table 7) that is designed to investigate the response of the climate system and carbon cycle to ocean alkalinization. The amount of any particular alkalizing agent that could be mined, processed, transported, and delivered to the ocean in a form that would easily dissolve and enhance alkalinity is poorly constrained (Köhler et al., 2013; Renforth et al., 2013). Therefore, the amount of alkalinity that is to be added in our experiment is set (based on exploratory simulations conducted with the CSIRO-Mk3L-COAL model) to have a cumulative effect on atmospheric CO2 by the year 2100 that is comparable to the amount removed in the CDRMIP instantaneous DAC simulations, i.e., an atmospheric reduction of ∼ 100 Gt C; experiments CDR-pi-pulse and CDR-yr2010-pulse. The idea here is not to test the maximum potential of such a method, which would be difficult given the still relatively coarse resolution of many models and the way in which ocean carbonate chemistry is simulated, but rather to compare the response of models to a significant alkalinity perturbation. We have also included an additional “termination” simulation that can be used to investigate an abrupt stop in ocean alkalinization deployment.",241.704177

One general side effect of ocean alkalinization is that it increases the buffering capacity and pH of the seawater. While such a side effect could be beneficial or even an intended effect to counter ocean acidification (Feng et al., 2016), high levels of alkalinity may also be detrimental to some organisms (Cripps et al., 2013). Ocean alkalinization likely also has method-specific side effects. Many of these side effects are related to the composition of the alkalizing agent, for example olivine may contain nutrients or toxic heavy metals, which could affect marine organisms and ecosystems (Hauck et al., 2016; Köhler et al., 2013). Other side effects could be caused by the mining, processing, and transport of the alkalizing agent, which in some cases may offset the CO2 sequestration potential of specific ocean alkalinization methods (e.g., through CO2 release by fossil fuel use or during the calcination of CaCO3; Kheshgi, 1995; Renforth et al., 2013).",241.44366

Enhanced weathering ideas have been proposed for both the terrestrial environment (Hartmann et al., 2013) and the ocean (Köhler et al., 2010; Schuiling and Krijgsman, 2006). We focus on the alkalinization of the ocean given its capacity to take up vast quantities of carbon over relatively short time periods and its potential to reduce the rate and impacts of ocean acidification (Kroeker et al., 2013). The idea is to dissolve silicate or carbonate min-erals in seawater to increase total alkalinity. Total alkalinity, which can chemically be defined as the excess of proton acceptors over proton donors with respect to a certain zero level of protons, is a measurable quantity that is related to the concentrations of species of the marine carbonate system (Wolf-Gladrow et al., 2007). It plays a key role in determining the air–sea gas exchange of CO2 (Egleston et al., 2010). When total alkalinity is artificially increased in surface waters, it basically allows more CO2 to dissolve in the seawater and be stored as ions such as bicarbonate or carbonate; i.e., the general methodology increases the carbon storage capacity of seawater.",241.44363

The first two idealized experiments described below use the approach of an instantaneous (pulse) CO2 removal from the atmosphere for this investigation. Instantaneous CO2 removal perturbations were chosen since pulsed CO2 addition experiments have already been proven useful for diagnosing carbon cycle and climate feedbacks in response to CO2 perturbations. For example, previous positive CO2 pulse experiments have been used to calculate global warming potential (GWP) and global temperature change potential (GTP) metrics (Joos et al., 2013). The experiments described below build upon the previous positive CO2 pulse experiments, i.e., the PD100 and PI100 impulse experiments described in Joos et al. (2013), in which 100 Gt C is instantly added to preindustrial and near present day simulated climates. However, our experiments also prescribe a negative CDR pulse as opposed to just adding CO2 to the atmosphere. Two experiments are desirable because the Earth system response to CO2 removal will be different when starting from an equilibrium state versus starting from a perturbed state (Zickfeld et al., 2016). One particular goal of these experiments is to estimate a global cooling potential (GCP) metric based on a CDR impulse response function (IRFCDR).

Laboratory studies and small-scale pilot plants have demonstrated that atmospheric CO2 can be captured by several different methods that are often collectively referred to as direct air capture (DAC) technology (Holmes and Keith, 2012; Lackner et al., 2012; Sanz-Pérez et al., 2016). Technology has also been developed that can place captured carbon in permanent reservoirs, i.e., carbon capture and storage (CCS) methods (Matter et al., 2016; Scott et al., 2013, 2015). DAC technology is currently prohibitively expensive to deploy on large scales and may be technically difficult to scale up (National Research Council, 2015), but it does appear to be a potentially viable CDR option.

Therefore, after careful consideration, one experiment was chosen specifically to address climate reversibility and several more were chosen to investigate CDR through the idealized direct air capture of CO2 (DAC), afforestation and reforestation, and ocean alkalinization (Table 1). Experiments are prioritized based on a tiered system, although we encourage modeling groups to complete the full suite of experiments. Unfortunately, limiting the number of experiments means that a number of potentially promising or widely utilized CDR methods or combinations of methods must wait until a later time, i.e., a second phase, to be investigated in a multi-model context.

The equilibrium response can be diagnosed following Gregory (2004), Frölicher et al. (2013), or if possible (desirable) by running the model to an equilibrium state at 2 × CO2 or 4 × CO2. – The C4MIP esm-ssp585 simulation is a high emission scenario and serves as a control run and branching pathway for the CDRMIP CDR-ocean-alk experiment. – The ScenarioMIP ssp534-over and ssp534-over-ext simulations, which prescribe the atmospheric CO2 concentration to follow an emission overshoot pathway that is followed by aggressive mitigation to reduce emissions to zero by about 2070, with substantial negative global emissions thereafter. These results can be qualitatively compared to CDRMIP experiment CDR-overshoot, which is the same scenario but driven by CO2 emissions. Model drift (Gupta et al., 2013; Séférian et al., 2016) is a concern for all CDRMIP experiments because if a model is not at an equilibrium state when the experiment or prerequisite CMIP experiment begins, then the response to any experimental perturbations could be confused by drift. Thus, before beginning any of the experiments a model must be spun up to eliminate long-term drift in carbon reservoirs or fluxes. Groups participating in CMIP6 should follow the C4MIP protocols described in Jones et al. (2016b) to ensure that drift is acceptably small. This means that land, ocean, and atmosphere carbon stores should each vary by less than 10 Gt C per century (long-term average ≤ 0.1 Gt C yr−1). We leave it to individual groups to determine the length of the run required to reach such a state.

Examples of this include scenarios that are being developed with GHG emission forcing that exceeds (or overshoots) what is required to limit global mean temperatures to 2 or 1.5 ◦C, with the assumption that reversibility is possible with the future deployment of CDR. These scenarios are generated using integrated assessment models, which compute the emissions of GHGs, short-lived climate forcers, and land cover change associated with economic, technological, and policy drivers to achieve climate targets. Most integrated assessment models represent BECCS as the only CDR option, with only a few also including afforestation (IPCC, 2014b). During scenario development and calibration the output from the IAMs is fed into climate models of reduced complexity, for example MAGICC (Model for the Assessment of Greenhouse-gas Induced Climate Change; Meinshausen et al., 2011), to calculate the global mean temperature achieved through the scenario choices, for example those in the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs; Riahi et al., 2017). These climate models are calibrated to Earth system models or based on modeling intercomparison exercises like the Coupled Model Intercomparison Phase 5 (CMIP5), in which much of the climate–carbon cycle information comes from the Coupled Climate–Carbon Cycle Model Intercomparison Project (C4MIP). However, since the carbon cycle feedbacks of large-scale negative CO2 emissions have not been explicitly analyzed in projects like CMIP5, with the exception of Jones et al.

While some proposed CDR methods do build upon substantial knowledge bases (e.g., soil and forest carbon, and ocean biogeochemistry), little research into large-scale CDR has been conducted and limited research resources applied (National Research Council, 2015; Oschlies and Klepper, 2017). The small number of existing laboratory studies and small-scale field trials of CDR methods were not designed to evaluate climate or carbon cycle responses to CDR. At the same time it is difficult to conceive how such an investigation could be carried out without scaling a method up to the point at which it would essentially be “deployment”. The few natural analogues that exist for some methods (e.g., weathering or reforestation) only provide limited insight into the effectiveness of deliberate large-scale CDR. As such, beyond syntheses of resource requirements and availabilities (e.g., Smith, 2016), there is a lack of observational constraints that can be applied to the assessment of the effectiveness of CDR methods. Lastly, many proposed CDR methods are premature at this point and technology deployment strategies would be required to overcome this barrier (Schäfer et al., 2015), which means that they can only be studied in an idealized manner, i.e., through model simulations.",240.94555

While there is some understanding of how the Earth system may respond to CDR, as described above, another dynamic comes into play if CDR were to be applied to “reverse” climate change. This is because if CDR were deployed for this purpose, it would deliberately change the climate, i.e., drive it in another direction, rather than just prevent it from changing by limiting CO2 emissions. Few studies have investigated how the Earth system may respond if CDR is applied in this manner. The link between cumulative CO2 emissions and global mean surface air temperature change has been extensively studied (IPCC, 2013). Can this change simply be reversed by removing the CO2 that has been emitted since the preindustrial era? Little is known about how reversible this relationship is or whether it applies to other Earth system properties (e.g., net primary productivity, sea level, etc.). Investigations of CDR-induced climate reversibility have suggested that many Earth system properties are “reversible”, but often with non-linear responses (Armour et al., 2011; Boucher et al., 2012; MacDougall, 2013; Tokarska and Zickfeld, 2015; Wang et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2014; Zickfeld et al., 2016). However, these analyses were generally limited to global annual mean values, and most models did not include potentially important components such as permafrost or terrestrial ice sheets. Thus, there are many unknowns and much uncertainty about whether it is possible to “reverse” climate change.

The impacts of these side effects tend to be method specific and may amplify or reduce the climate change mitigation potential of the method. Some significant side effects are caused by the spatial scale (e.g., millions of km2) on which many methods would have to be deployed to have a significant impact upon CO2 and global temperatures (Boysen et al., 2016; Heck et al., 2016; Keller et al., 2014). Side effects can also potentially alter the natural environment by disrupting biogeochemical and hydrological cycles, ecosystems, and biodiversity (Keller et al., 2014). For example, large-scale afforestation could change regional albedo and evapotranspiration and have a biogeophysical impact on the Earth’s energy budget and climate (Betts, 2000; Keller et al., 2014). Additionally, if afforestation were done with non-native plants or monocultures to increase carbon removal rates, this could impact local biodiversity. For human societies, this means that CDR-related side effects could potentially impact the ecosystem services provided by the land and ocean (e.g., food production), with the information so far suggesting that there could be both positive and negative impacts on these services. Such effects could change societal responses and strategies for climate change adaptation if large-scale CDR were to be deployed.",502.2307

Understanding and accounting for the feedbacks between these reservoirs in response to CDR is particularly important for understanding the efficacy of any method (Keller et al., 2014). For example, when CO2 is removed from the atmosphere in simulations, the rate of oceanic CO2 uptake, which has historically increased in response to increasing emissions, is reduced and might eventually reverse (i.e., net outgassing) because of a reduction in the air–sea flux disequilibrium (Cao and Caldeira, 2010; Jones et al., 2016a; Tokarska and Zickfeld, 2015; Vichi et al., 2013). Equally, the terrestrial carbon sink also weakens in response to atmospheric CO2 removal and can also become a source of CO2 to the atmosphere (Cao and Caldeira, 2010; Jones et al., 2016a; Tokarska and Zickfeld, 2015).

Idealized Earth system model simulations suggest that CDR does appear to be able to limit or even reverse warming and changes in many other key climate variables (Boucher et al., 2012; Tokarska and Zickfeld, 2015; Wu et al., 2014; Zickfeld et al., 2016).

Climate “reversibility” by assessing the efficacy of using CDR to return high future atmospheric CO2 concentrations to lower levels. This topic is highly idealized, as the technical ability of CDR methods to remove such enormous quantities of CO2 on relatively short timescales (i.e., this century) is doubtful. However, the results will provide information on the degree to which a changing and changed climate could be returned to a previous state. This knowledge is especially important since socioeconomic scenarios that limit global warming to well below 2 ◦C often feature radiative forcing overshoots that must be ”reversed” using CDR. Specific questions on reversibility will address the following. 1. What components of the Earth’s climate system exhibit “reversibility” when CO2 increases and then decreases? On what timescales do these “reversals” occur? And if reversible, is this complete reversibility or just on average (are there spatial and temporal aspects)? ii. The potential efficacy, feedbacks, and side effects of specific CDR methods. Efficacy is defined here as CO2 removed from the atmosphere over a specific time horizon as a result of a specific unit of CDR action. This topic will help to better constrain the carbon sequestration potential and risks and/or benefits of selected methods. Together, a rigorous analysis of the nature, sign, and timescales of these CDR-related topics will provide important information for the inclusion of CDR in climate mitigation scenarios and in resulting mitigation and adaptation policy strategies. Specific questions on individual CDR methods will address the following. 1. How much CO2 would have to be removed to return to a specified concentration level, for example present day or preindustrial? 2. What are the short-term carbon cycle feedbacks (e.g., rebound) associated with the method? 3. What are the short- and longer-term physical, chemical, and biological impacts and feedbacks and the potential side effects of the method? 4. For methods that enhance natural carbon uptake, for example afforestation or ocean alkalinization, where is the carbon stored (land and ocean) and for how long (i.e., issues of permanence; at least as much as this can be calculated with these models)?",240.9458

First and foremost, CDRMIP will provide information that can be used to help assess the potential and risks of using CDR to address climate change. A thorough assessment will need to look at both the impacts of CDR upon the Earth system and human society. CDRMIP will focus primarily on Earth system impacts, with the anticipation that this information will also be useful for understanding potential impacts upon society. The scientific outcomes will lead to more informed decisions about the role CDR may play in climate change mitigation (defined here as a human intervention to reduce the sources or enhance the sinks of greenhouse gases). CDRMIP experiments will also provide an opportunity to better understand how the Earth system responds to perturbations, which is relevant to many of the Grand Science Challenges posed by the World Climate Research Program (WCRP; https://www.wcrp-climate.org/ grand-challenges/grand-challenges-overview). CDRMIP experiments provide a unique opportunity because the perturbations are often opposite in sign to previous CMIP perturbation experiments (CO2 is removed instead of added). Second, CDRMIP results may also be able to provide information that helps to understand how model resolution and complexity cause systematic model bias. In this instance, CDRMIP experiments may be especially useful for gaining a better understanding of the similarities and differences between global carbon cycle models because we invite a diverse group of models to participate in CDRMIP. Finally, CDRMIP results can help to quantify uncertainties in future climate change scenarios, especially those that include CDR. In this case CDRMIP results may be useful for calibrating CDR inclusion in IAMs during the scenario development process.",241.44364

To do this a massive climate change mitigation effort to reduce the sources or enhance the sinks of greenhouse gases (IPCC, 2014b) must be undertaken. Even if significant efforts are made to reduce CO2 emissions, it will likely take decades before net emissions approach zero (Bauer et al., 2017; Riahi et al., 2017; Rogelj et al., 2015a), a level that is likely required to reach and maintain such temperature targets (Rogelj et al., 2015b). Changes in the climate will therefore continue for some time, with future warming strongly dependent on cumulative CO2 emissions (Allen et al., 2009; IPCC, 2013; Matthews et al., 2009), and there is the possibility that “severe, pervasive and irreversible” impacts will occur if too much CO2 is emitted (IPCC, 2013, 2014a). The lack of agreement on how to sufficiently reduce CO2 emissions in a timely manner and the magnitude of the task required to transition to a low carbon world has led to increased attention to what is called geoengineering, climate engineering, or climate intervention. These terms are all used to define actions that deliberately manipulate the climate system in an attempt to ameliorate or reduce the impact of climate change by either modifying the Earth’s radiation budget (solar radiation management, or SRM) or removing the primary greenhouse gas, CO2, from the atmosphere (carbon dioxide removal, or CDR; National Research Council, 2015). In particular, there is an increasing focus and study on the potential of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) methods to offset emissions and eventually enable “net negative emissions”, whereby more CO2 is removed via CDR than is emitted by anthropogenic activities, to complement emissions reduction efforts. CDR has also been proposed as a means of “reversing” climate change if too much CO2 is emitted; i.e., CDR may be able to reduce atmospheric CO2 to return radiative forcing to some target level.",240.991216

The recent IPCC reports state that continued anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are changing the climate, threatening “severe, pervasive and irreversible” impacts. Slow progress in emissions reduction to mitigate climate change is resulting in increased attention to what is called geoengineering, climate engineering, or climate intervention – deliberate interventions to counter climate change that seek to either modify the Earth’s radiation budget or remove greenhouse gases such as CO2 from the atmosphere. When focused on CO2, the latter of these categories is called carbon dioxide removal (CDR). Future emission scenarios that stay well below 2 ◦C, and all emission scenarios that do not exceed 1.5 ◦C warming by the year 2100, require some form of CDR. At present, there is little consensus on the climate impacts and atmospheric CO2 reduction efficacy of the different types of proposed CDR. To address this need, the Carbon Dioxide Removal Model Intercomparison Project (or CDRMIP) was initiated. This project brings together models of the Earth system in a common framework to explore the potential, impacts, and challenges of CDR. Here, we describe the first set of CDRMIP experiments, which are formally part of the 6th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). These experiments are designed to address questions concerning CDR-induced climate “reversibility”, the response of the Earth system to direct atmospheric CO2 removal (direct air capture and storage), and the CDR potential and impacts of afforestation and reforestation, as well as ocean alkalinization.

The model lacks backstop technologies for solids and liquids, although biomass solids and liquids are available (with resource constraints). These deficiencies might be one of the reasons for high carbon prices and GDP losses found in the 450 scenario, which warrant further investigation. Another key problem is its treatment of energy efficiency barriers. It is well known that there are various barriers that prevent economically beneficial measures ofenergy efficiency, but such effects are not represented in the current configuration of the BET model. It is possible to use hurdle rates for end-use technologies to crudely incorporate aspects of efficiency barriers. This is also left for future analysis (for a full list of topics of future work, see the ESM). Though we explored the importance of end-use technologies by conducting sensitivity analyses, a more systematic approach is desired.

The BET model includes advanced end-use technologies such as industrial induction heaters, industrial heat-pump heaters, heat-pump water heaters in the residential and commercial sectors, road freight hybrid trucks, and road passenger electric vehicles. The BET model allows us to examine the role played by electrification and advanced end-use technologies to achieve a climate target in a more systematic fashion, ranging from changes in usage of end-use technologies to power generation mix. Using the BET model, we have conducted simulations and obtained the following results. (1) Turning off the advanced end-use technologies results in GDP losses, even in the scenario without GHG constraints. Such losses become larger with a more stringent climate policy. The model results suggest that the advanced end-use technologies are a promising way to contain GDP loss when the climate target is stringent. (2) Advanced end-use technologies are important in reducing carbon prices, especially in the scenarios with stringent GHG constraints. (3) Electricity demand is relatively stable, but non-electricity demand decreases as the GHG constraints become more stringent. This is because electricity can be supplied using various low-carbon options such as renewables, nuclear energy, and fossils with CCS.

It increases substantially with time, roughly doubling in 2050, and tripling in 2100 (Fig. 5). Energy services generally take various units (vehicle-km-traveled for passenger transportation and GJ for heating, for instance), and are not amenable to comparison across sectors. Here, we choose to represent energy services in energy units, using the efficiencies listed in Table 2 of the ESM. When the GHG constraints are strict, the final energy demands decrease on a large scale. The final energy demands in the 650, 550, and 450 scenarios in 2050 are lower by 18 %, 29 %, and 45 %, respectively, as compared to those in the Base scenario. The CO2 emissions in the 650, 550, 450 scenarios in 2100 are lower by 40 %, 49 %, 55 %, respectively, as compared to those in the Base scenario (Fig. 5). The simulation results show that the electricity demand is relatively stable (see 3.3), but the non-electricity demand decreases as the GHG constraints become more stringent (Fig. 5). This is because electricity can be supplied by various low-carbon options such as renewables, nuclear, and fossils with CCS, but non-electricity supply is limited to a few low-carbon options such as biomass. Hence, the electrification rates based on the total final energy supply increase, when the GHG constraints are stringent. The electrification rates on the total final energy supply in the Base scenario without GHG constraints increase from 15 % in 2010 to 19 % in 2050 and 24 % in 2100. Furthermore, the electrification rates in the scenarios with GHG constraints increase rapidly. The electrification rates with GHG constraints in 2050 increase to 22 % in the 650 scenario, 24 % in the 550 scenario, and 33 % in the 450 scenario. The electrification rates in 2100 reach 35 % in the 650 scenario, 41 % in the 550 scenario, and 44 % in the 450 scenario. Since the BET model includes end-use technologies, it can calculate energy services. The simulation results show that the advanced end-use technology of hybrid trucks supplies road freight services but the advanced electric end-use technologies do not supply any services in 2050 in the Base scenario. As the GHG constraints become stricter, the advanced electric end-use technologies such as heat-pump water heaters supply more energy services. The amount of the energy services using electricity is more stable than that of the other energy services under stringent GHG constraints (Fig. 5). This is because the advanced electric end-use technologies with high energy efficiency can supply a large amount of energy services for a small amount of electricity. The non-electric energy services decrease under stringent GHG constraints, since only an advanced non-electric end-use technology, i.e., hybrid truck technology in the road freight sector, is available in the BET model. Hence, the electrification rates based on energy services are high under stringent GHG constraints. The electrification rate in the Base scenario without GHG constraints increases moderately from 25 % in 2010 to 41 % in 2100. The electrification rates in the scenarios with GHG constraints in 2100 rise to 57 % in the 650 scenario, 63 % in the 550 scenario, and 65 % in the 450 scenario. The electrification rates on based on energy services with GHG constraints and without the advanced end-use technologies are over 8 % lower than those with the advanced end-use technologies in 2100. The electrification rates are increased by the advanced electric end-use technologies.

Thus, global CO2 emissions continue to increase. The global CO2 emissions, which are the sum of emissions from fossil fuel, industrial processes, and land-use changes, increase from 31 Gt-CO2 in 2010 (model value, not observation) to 71 Gt-CO2 in 2050 and 93 Gt-CO2 in 2100 (see Fig. 4 in the ESM). The CO2 emissions are reduced in the scenarios with GHG constraints. The CO2 emission in 2100 is reduced to 10 Gt-CO2 in the 650 scenario, 4.7 Gt-CO2 in the 550 scenario, and 1.1 Gt-CO2 in the 450 scenario. The availability of the advanced end-use technologies does not affect the CO2 emission paths clearly, since the CO2 budget constraints virtually prescribe the shapes of the emission paths. CCS technologies are introduced on a large scale in the scenarios with GHG constraints. The amounts ofCCS in 2050 are 1 Gt-CO2 in the 650 scenario, 4 Gt-CO2 in the 550 scenario, and 6 Gt-CO2 in the 450 scenario. The amounts ofCCS in 2100 are 17 Gt-CO2 in the 650 scenario, 17 Gt-CO2 in the 550 scenario, and 16 Gt-CO2 in the 450 scenario. The amounts of CCS in the scenarios with GHG constraints are close in 2100. This is because the cumulative amounts of CCS in the scenarios with GHG constraints are close to the limit ofthe carbon storage capacity. The large portion of the introduced CCS is occupied by BECCS (Bio-Electricity with Carbon Capture and Storage). For example, the ratio of BECCS to the total CCS in 2100 is 78 % in the 650 scenario, 76 % in the 550 scenario, and 79 % in the 450 scenario. BECCS is a key technology to reduce CO2 emissions on a large scale. As GHG constraints become stricter, the carbon prices increase. The carbon prices in 2050 are $52/t-CO2 in the 650 scenario, $128/t-CO2 in the 550 scenario, and $365/t-CO2 in the 450 scenario (Fig. 4). The carbon prices in 2100 are much more higher than those in 2050. The carbon prices in 2100 rise to $405/t-CO2 in the 650 scenario, $995/t-CO2 in the 550 scenario, and $ 2,842/t-CO2 in the 450 scenario.",346.958072

Electricity generation is not sensitive to climate policy. There are various low-carbon electricity supply technologies such as non-fossil-fuel technologies and carbon capture and storage (CCS). These ensure that the demand for electricity remains relatively unaffected by GHG constraints. The composition of electricity generation, however, differs markedly across scenarios (Fig. 3). In the Base scenario without carbon constraints, coal (without CCS) dominates electricity generation, providing over 80 % of the total in 2050 and approximately 50 % in 2100. In 2100, other technologies make penetration as well, with nuclear energy providing about 22 %, hydropower 8 %, and wind energy 12 %. By imposing a climate policy, power generation using coal without CCS is cut down. In 2050, its share reduces to 38 %, 12 %, and 1 % in the 650, 550, and 450 scenarios, respectively. Coal’s role diminishes further in 2100, with its share dropping to a mere 1 % even in the 650 scenario. The preferred generation technologies under climate policy are biomass and gas, both with CCS. Biomass with CCS contributes 17–19 % and gas with CCS 16–19 % to power generation in 2100. As climate policy becomes more stringent, more solar and wind is introduced. In the 450 scenario, the shares of solar and wind in 2100 are 14 % and 15 %, respectively. Note that it is assumed the ceiling of solar and wind penetration at 30 % (see the ESM). A comparison of the 650, 550, and 450 scenarios with the 650-off, 550-off, and 450-off scenarios reveals that advanced end-use technologies allow for an increase in electricity generation.

The energy module is formulated with linear functions and constraints. The primary energy in the BET model consists of coal, oil, natural gas, biomass, nuclear, hydro, wind, photovoltaic, geothermal, electric-backstop, and gaseous-backstop. The final energy consists of solid, liquid, gaseous, and electricity. Coal can be converted to synthetic oil. Biomass can be converted to solid, liquid, and gaseous fuels. The power generation sub-module in BET takes into account capacity constraints and the lifetime ofeach generation plant. In addition, it considers the load duration curve, discretized into four sections, ranging from year maximum hours, peak hours, shoulder hours, to bottom hours. Though crudely, this captures some aspects ofeconomic dispatch control ofthe power systems. Since it does not incorporate adjustments for fluctuations on shorter timescales (e.g., via load frequency control), BET has a generation constraint on solar and wind, which are intermittent renewables (see the ESM). Each generation technology has its own characteristics so that the model endogenously solves for the capacity and power mix. In the BET model, there are 20 kinds of energy services (Table 1). Out of the 20, eight services have competing technologies. There are 31 competing technologies in total, including heat pump water heaters and traditional fossil boilers (see the ESM). For the remaining 12 services, the amounts of energy services are essentially equivalent to final energy demands (aside from some coefficients to adjust for efficiencies). In modeling energy services, we followed and simplified the approach used by the UK MARKAL (UK Energy Research Centre 2010), as the BET model is a long-term, global model, in contrast with the UK MARKAL, which focuses on domestic analyses. Since the BET model enables us to examine the role played by electrification and advanced end-use technologies, it includes 11 kinds ofelectric end-use technologies such as heat pump water heaters and electric passenger vehicles of 31 kinds of all end-use technologies. However, the model does not include non-electric end-use technologies such as hybrid passenger vehicles and fuel cell vehicles in the transportation sector. These technologies will be included in the future study. The list of end-use technologies is short, and will be expanded in the future.

The details of the model structure and parameters are described in the Electronic Supplementary Material (ESM). The BET model is a neoclassical optimal growth model hard-linked with an energy systems module, which includes both energy supply technologies and end-use technologies, and a climate module (not used in this study). Roughly speaking, the BET model can be summed up as “a MERGE with advanced, electric end-use technologies” or “a global MARKAL-MACRO with limited technologies”. The macroeconomic production function is identical to that ofMARKAL-MACRO (Loulou et al. 2004), the inputs of which are not final energy amounts but energy services. Since MARKAL-MACRO is a regional model but the BET model is a global model, the latter solves a market equilibrium as a social planner’s problem using Negishi weights (Negishi 1960). The energy systems module, the structure ofwhich is similar to that ofMARKAL-MACRO (Loulou et al. 2004), describes not only energy supply systems such as mining, fuel conversions, and power generation, but also end-use systems such as end-use technologies that convert final energy to energy services. The end-use technologies in the BET model, which are simplified compared with those in MARCAL-MACRO of the regional model with detailed end-use technologies, include advanced technologies such as heat-pump water heaters for industry, commercial and residential, and electric vehicles for road passenger services in order to evaluate the mitigation effects of advanced electrification technologies. The BET model includes a simple carbon-climate module called SEEPLUS, the carbon cycle of which simulates nonlinear processes of natural CO2 absorption using climate impulse functions (Tsutsui 2011). The simple carbon-climate module is not active in this study, since the climate targets of the BET model are not CO2 concentrations but rather CO2 emission budgets in the EMF27 protocol (Kriegler et al. 2013). The world is divided into 13 regions: the USA (United States of America), EU27 +3 (European Union 27 plus Iceland, Switzerland, and Norway), CANZ (Canada, Australia, and New Zealand), Japan, Russia, China, India, Other Asia, Other Europe (including countries in the Former Soviet Union except Russia), MENA (Middle East and North Africa), Sub-Sahara Africa (including South Africa), Brazil, and Other Latin America. The calculation period is 2000 to 2230 with a 10-year time step, although the reporting period is until 2100 in EMF27. The calculation period is extended beyond 2100 to avoid terminal effects.

To date, a number of analyses have been conducted to assess climate policy (Weyant 1999, 2004; Weyant et al. 2006). Recently, advanced end-use technologies have received increasing attention as a key component of options for climate change mitigation (Kyle et al. 2011). In particular, advanced electric technologies are found to play an important role. Electric end-use technologies are promising since they are increasingly affordable and present high end-use efficiencies. Combined with various types of non-fossil power generation technologies, they lead to an increased share of electricity in the final energy consumption (Manne and Richels 1992; Edmonds et al. 2006; Sugiyama 2012 and references therein). To realistically assess the potential of end-use efficiency and electrification, IAMs need to realistically represent supply and end-use technologies as well as macroeconomic effects such as substitution between energy and capital/labor. Many of the contemporary IAMs are increasingly capable of representing technological detail and economic interactions because of continuing trend of hybridization (Sugiyama et al. 2013). Partial equilibrium models such as TIAM (Loulou and Labriet 2008), POLES (Criqui et al. 1999), AIM/Enduse (Kainuma et al. 2000), and DNE21+ (Akimoto et al. 2008), incorporate some degree of economic effects. On the other hand, general equilibrium models such as MERGE (Richels and Blanford 2008) and ReMIND (Leimbach et al. 2010) nowadays explicitly incorporate end-use technologies within a macroeconomic framework in a global IAM based on Ramsey’s optimal growth theory, extending classical IAMs (Nordhaus 1994; Manne et al. 1995). WITCH (Bosetti et al. 2006) is a top-down neoclassical optimal growth model with a specification of energy services. MESSAGE-MACRO (Messner and Schrattenholzer 2000) links an energy supply model (Schrattenholzer 1981) with a macroeconomic module and solves it iteratively. Nevertheless, more progress is needed to systematically understand the role of end-use energy efficiency. This is because, although energy efficiency is a very old topic, the economy-wide effect of advanced end-use technologies is a relatively new one (Kyle et al. 2011). In fact, many of the IAMs of the top-down origin have explicit representation of the transport sector, but not of industry and buildings sectors (Sugiyama et al. 2013). Herein, we present a new model called the BET (Basic Energy systems, Economy, Environment, and End-use Technology) model that also includes explicit end-use representation in a global IAM based on Ramsey’s optimal growth theory. It is strongly influenced by MERGE (Manne et al. 1995; Richels and Blanford 2008) and MARKAL-MACRO (Loulou et al. 2004), which is closely related with TIAM. The feature of the BET model is to include several advanced end-use technologies using electricity such as heat pump water heaters for industry, commercial, and household. Although qualitatively speaking, most of our results here are reconfirmation of previous studies, the BET model enables us to examine the role played by electrification and advanced end-use technologies to achieve a certain climate target more systematically, ranging from changes in usage of end-use technologies to power generation mix.",346.877717

Thus, a more complicated modeling of the biomass energy system where the input energy would be considered, would not change the overall results of this paper (here we once again assume that badly performing biomass energy systems such as ethanol derived from corn are not used). 8In the absence of US participation, there is a theoretical risk that the cost will drop to very low levels or even zero because of the “hot air” in the former Soviet Union (FSU), at least under the assumption that the Kyoto–Marrakech system will operate like an entirely free market (see Nordhaus, 2001). This is however, rather unlikely, for several reasons. FSU may act as a “monopolist” and thereby increase the permit price (see Persson and Azar, 2003), and EU/Canada/Japan are unlikely to pay Russia for doing nothing. 9Storage in the oceans is politically sensitive, and one research project where only 20 tons of liquefied CO2 were to be injected at the bottom of the ocean floor just outside Hawaii recently had to be cancelled before it was started because of local opposition (GECR, 2002). The project was then invited to Norway, but opposition from Greenpeace and the World Wide Fund for Nature led the government to withdraw an approval granted by the Norwegian Pollution Control Authority (Giles, 2002). 10As mentioned earlier, we have set the maximum expansion rate of carbon capture and storage at 100 MtC/year/year. Thus at the end of the century, at most 10 GtC/year may be captured. For solar hydrogen, the maximum expansion rate is 0.3 TW/year/year. For biomass the expansion rate is set at 0.1 TW/year/year and for all other conversion technologies 0.2 TW/year/year. 11If expansion constraints are too severe, more expensive technologies will enter to relieve the constraint (e.g., if the demand for energy grows very fast in a model with one low cost and one high cost technology, the high cost technology may enter even if it would be cheaper to expand the low cost option). 12This number is obtained by assuming that the GDP level is given by the expected GDP level minus the annual cost associated with the additional energy systems cost. 13There is, however, one exception to that, and that is when we run a case without BECS being allowed. Then CO2 emissions released from plants with carbon capture and storage (assumed to be 10%) become so large that the emission constraint is exceeded. For that reason solar hydrogen enters. Thus, in this scenario, solar hydrogen enters by the middle of the century and reaches close to 400 EJ/year by the end of the century. (Note that this is a very model-specific result in the sense that a high carbon tax in the real world would mean that there would be strong incentives to increase the capture rate to levels higher than 90%. These dynamics are not modeled.). 14Some have expressed concern that BECS will further exacerbate this potential problem, but it should be noted that BECS also implies that emission reductions are delayed and that less solar-derived energy will be needed if the objective is to meet an atmospheric CO2 concentration target by the year 2100. For that reason the willingness to pay for biomass in our model is actually lower in the no capture case than in the fossil capture and the BECS case. – Long-term potentials’, in Lygnfelt, A., et al., 2001, proceedings from carbon sequestration symposium at Chalmers Oct 26, 2001.

Net present value of extra energy systems costs in a high energy demand case. The cost is calculated as the extra energy system cost to meet a 350 and a 450 ppm atmospheric CO2 concentration targets by the year 2100. 1See Alcamo and Kreileman (1996); Azar and Rodhe (1997); Azar and Schneider (2001); O’Neill and Oppenheimer (2002), for discussions about stabilization targets. 2We extrapolated the demands linearly from 2100 to 2130 and thereafter kept the demands fixed throughout the optimisation period. The reason why the model is run until 2300 is that we wanted to avoid boundary value problems, and also that we (in another project) investigated what the steady state solutions might look like. 3The natural gas and coal prices are rounded from WEA (2000) estimates of late-1990s fuel prices in the US. The oil price corresponds to 21 USD/barrel. Biomass prices are typically below 2 USD/GJ in developing countries, but higher in developed countries (WEA 2000, p. 227). 4Some might argue that carbon capture from biomass plants is not plausible because such plants are often small. However, studies of carbon capture from pulp mills suggest the feasibility of this technology (Möllersten and Yan, 2001; Ekström et al., 1997). In typical pulp mills, carbon emissions are around 40 kg CO2/s. A 400 MWth biomass plant has the same carbon emissions. We assume that the additional transportation cost is 0.5 USD/GJ for a large biomass plant over a small biomass plant. This corresponds to the transport cost of salix for an additional 50 km by truck (Börjesson and Gustavsson, 1996). It may be noted that the yield of biomass within a radius of 50 km, with a planting density of 10% and a harvest of 200 GJ/ha/year, would be 500 MWth. 5We have abstained from depicting the price development over time. There are reasons to be careful when interpreting the so-called marginals of the energy balance equations in linear programming models with perfect foresight, expansion rate constraints and a stringent target that has to be met at a certain point in time, as prices. The reason for that is that an expansion constraint rate on, say, solar makes it necessary to introduce solar earlier than otherwise if a given carbon target should be met in, say the year 2100. The model then gives a high enough “price” on carbon (i.e., the carbon tax, or the permit price) in the year 2100 so that it becomes economically justifiable to introduce solar and other technologies in earlier periods in time. A very high “price” towards the end implies that a lower price is required in initial periods. In reality, however, no private company would act with such long time horizons, and therefore the internally generated prices during the initial periods in time are probably too low to generate the scenario in the real world. 6CO2 injection is assumed to take place in CO2-retaining deep saline aquifers and the depth of the injection wells was set to 1000 m. Capital costs were annualised using an interest rate of 10% and a plant life of 25 years. A capacity utilization of 90% was applied. 7In the graphs, we have not included the carbon emissions associated with biomass production and transportation. However, as stated above, the energy use in these activities may account to some 5% of the energy content in the biomass. If all that input energy would come from coal, then the carbon emission factor associated with biomass energy would still be lower than the emission factor for coal with carbon capture and storage (under the assumption that 90% of the carbon is captured).",358.65601

The capture and storage of CO2 from combustion of fossil fuels is gaining attraction as a means to deal with climate change. CO2 emissions from biomass conversion processes can also be captured. If that is done, biomass energy with CO2 capture and storage (BECS) would become a technology that removes CO2 from the atmosphere and at the same time deliver CO2-neutral energy carriers (heat, electricity or hydrogen) to society. Here we present estimates of the costs and conversion efficiency of electricity, hydrogen and heat generation from fossil fuels and biomass with CO2 capture and storage. We then insert these technology characteristics into a global energy and transportation model (GET 5.0), and calculate costs of stabilizing atmospheric CO2 concentration at 350 and 450 ppm. We find that carbon capture and storage technologies applied to fossil fuels have the potential to reduce the cost of meeting the 350 ppm stabilisation targets by 50% compared to a case where these technologies are not available and by 80% when BECS is allowed. For the 450 ppm scenario, the reduction in costs is 40 and 42%, respectively. Thus, the difference in costs between cases where BECS technologies are allowed and where they are not is marginal for the 450 ppm stabilization target. It is for very low stabilization targets that negative emissions become warranted, and this makes BECS more valuable than in cases with higher stabilization targets. Systematic and stochastic sensitivity analysis is performed. Finally, BECS opens up the possibility to remove CO2 from the atmosphere. But this option should not be seen as an argument in favour of doing nothing about the climate problem now and then switching on this technology if climate change turns out to be a significant problem. It is not likely that BECS can be initiated sufficiently rapidly at a sufficient scale to follow this path to avoiding abrupt and serious climate changes if that would happen.",358.66476

For this purpose, we introduce a set of model experiments that examine the relationship between bio-energy and land-use emissions in IMAGE. In IMAGE, bio-energy can be produced on abandoned agricultural land and on natural grassland. Forests, nature reserves, non-productive land and urban land are assumed to be excluded (representing a situation where so-called sustainability criteria are successfully introduced). Using forest areas for bio-energy production would usually be counterproductive, given the carbon consequences. Not only do the sustainability criteria constrain bio-energy, but they also diminish the indirect impacts (such as converting other land to forest). We assume that the world will indeed evolve in this direction, but this is by no means certain. It will require sustainability criteria for bio-energy production and other forms of land-use to be enforced worldwide. This might be achieved by ensuring that deforestation emissions are properly accounted for in the UNFCCC, or by more stringent national land-use policies. In order to explore the relationship between bio-energy use and land-use emissions, we ran a set of scenarios in which the deployment of bio-energy production was increased for all regions, from the low production levels included in the baseline scenarios, to levels near the maximum potential in IMAGE (i.e. 10%, 50%, 70% and 90% of the maximum potential). These experiments were run separately for abandoned agricultural land and natural grassland (thus in total 8 model runs). Whereas on natural grassland the production of bio-energy does lead to CO2 emissions because the natural vegetation is removed before bio-energy production can commence, on abandoned agricultural land bio-energy production also leads to net emissions compared to the baseline, because if the land had not been brought into use for bio-fuel production, the natural vegetation would have returned.",221.8617

Although an optimal economically efficient response would probably be one that is global and coordinated, the current approach to global climate policy consists of voluntary pledges. As a result, the efficacy of this climate policy depends on individual country ambitions. In such a situation, leakage of CO2 could play a role. In this paper, we investigate this using the IMAGE model. Fragmented climate policy with first movers could lead to carbon leakage from the energy system to land use through bio-energy demand. If only long-term dynamics are taken into account, the impacts are around 5% of the emissions avoided. The vast majority of the total leakage found with IMAGE (about 90%) will occur via the energy market channel; the remaining 10% will occur through land use. Our finding that total leakage is about 5% ofthe emissions avoided in the region taking action suggests that the impact of land use change is limited. The leakage impacts in the energy sectors are found to be strongest in the power and transport sectors. The decrease in demand for fossil fuels in the EU and China results in a fall of the price of fossil fuels on the global market. A fall of the price of fossil fuels causes demand in regions outside the EU and China to rise. In contrast, the increased bio-energy price increases bio-energy exports in regions outside the EU and China reducing domestic demand. The level of fuel demand depends on sectoral energy use in different regions. The change in oil demand is particularly seen in the transport sector, with a noticeable impact in North America. Additional demand for coal comes mainly from the electricity sector (replacing bio-energy), which is particularly seen in Asia and Oceania. An increase in production of bio-energy may lead to an increase of CO2 emissions related to land use. It is difficult to prevent the “leakage” impacts in both the energy system and the land-use system. In the case of land use in particular, an increase in bio-energy production will result in more CO2 emissions related to land use, both in scenarios that are based on a global response as well as in fragmented policy scenarios [24]. It should be noted that the increase in land use emissions is mostly temporary, whereas the gains in reduced fossil emissions increase over time.",221.863247

These results are within the range found in the AMPERE study [17]. This study looked into carbon leakage effects of the fossil fuel markets for the period 2010–2030 by means of different models (10) and found large range of results from −0.1 to 47.8 Gt CO2. Interestingly, the IMAGE leakage rate increases over time and is still quite small in the period up to 2030. This has two reasons; first, the price differences in IMAGE, induced by the domestic climate policies, are a result of depletion dynamics (less fossil fuel consumption), an effect that only becomes apparent over time. Secondly, IMAGE includes (technological) inertia which implies that the model cannot directly respond to the price differences. Therefore, in this paper we take a longer time frame (2010–2050) and include emissions from land use. In this period we find a higher leakage rate of ~5% (10 Gt CO2, see Section 3.1). Three aspects suggest that our estimates are conservative even on the longer term. First, in IMAGE, the impact ofleakage is only covered by long-term dynamics: short-term impacts (such as oil price reductions resulting from under-exploitation of existing capital) are not included in the model. Secondly, the relocation of energy intensive industries is not captured in the analysis and thirdly, we assume that all bio-energy production is subject to sustainability criteria and occurs only on abandoned agricultural land or natural grassland. However, in practice, this is not necessary the case, resulting potentially in more LUC emissions than anticipated [20,23]. Several of the scenarios explored in this paper change course after 20 years. However, the policies continue to affect energy production and emissions for 30–40 years after they are abandoned. Also this results from inertia. An important reason for the inertia is the lifetime of capital: for example, bio-energy power plants have a lifetime of 30–40 years. The investment tied up in the transport sector will cause global oil consumption to be lower until around 2060, as bio-fuel production continues. However, this decrease is offset by oil consumption increasing at a later date in response to lower oil prices. In the natural system, emissions emitted (or avoided) in the next 30 years will lead to a higher (or lower) average CO2 concentration for the 21st century. Many papers have explored the potential impact of bio-energy use on emissions related to land use [20,24–26]. The calculations we have presented confirm the importance of such land use change related emissions. In the scenarios we have explored, the demand for bio-energy in EU and China surpasses domestic production significantly and therefore both regions must import bio-energy from other regions (and in much greater amounts than is the case in uniform policy scenarios, because demand is lower in exporting regions). In exporting regions, demand decreases (as a result of the price increase) and production rises. The decrease actually somewhat offsets the potential leakage impacts.",221.89719

The land-use emissions at low levels ofbio-energy production result from the land-use changes that are already included in the baseline scenario and are mostly driven by food production. The figure, however, shows that increasing bio-energy production worldwide leads to higher CO2 emissions related to land use (over the range explored, the average impact increases linearly). The emissions from production of different bio-fuel crops on abandoned agricultural land are slightly higher than those from bio-fuel production on natural grassland, as abandoned land is more productive in terms of net primary production (NPP) than natural grassland. Fig. 7 shows regional bio-energy production and demand in RefPol and RefP-CEback scenarios for 2010–2050. The results show that in both scenarios the demand for bio-energy in China and the EU considerably exceeds local production (indicating that a substantial part of the bio-energy is imported). In the RefPol scenario, this is mostly a consequence of the relatively stringent policies that have been assumed for the EU and that lead to bio-energy imports. The RefP-CEback scenario results in a further increase of bio-energy demand in both the EU and China. The higher demand leads not only to some increase in production in the region concerned (China and EU by 220 EJ) but also to a big increase in imports. This import is possible due to the potential for relatively cheap bio-energy to be produced in regions elsewhere, where demand for bio-energy is low (even stimulated by the effect on oil prices noted earlier). As a result, production of bio-energy increases in all regions by 262 EJ compared to RefPol. All other regions have a surplus of bio-energy production. The higher production causes bio-energy prices in these exporting regions to rise, resulting in a slight reduction in domestic consumption. We can estimate the potential savings by the bio-energy use in the EU and China by assuming that the additional bio-energy mostly replaces oil. In that case, increased CO2 emission associated with bio-fuel crops in both China and EU and the other regions is about 2.2% of the carbon saved. The effect of climate policy in the EU and China is particularly marked in the Russian and Central Asian region, with a production increase by more than 200% as compared to the RefPol scenario. This region has a relatively high potential to produce bio-energy from abandoned agricultural land and natural grasslands. In contrast, in most tropical regions the area required for food production increases, limiting the scope for rapid expansion of crops grown for bio-fuel. Growing bio-fuel crops on abandoned agricultural land implies that the forest regrowth that would normally happen in absence of this activity is precluded. Hence emissions will rise by comparison with the reference case. Moreover, in the case of natural grassland, some existing natural biomass cover is removed. We expect that land-use CO2 emissions that result from bio-fuel crop expansion depend on the vegetation of the area used for growing these crops, which, in turn, is dependent on geography and local climate [21]. This implies that the relationship between bio-energy production and energy supply (shown globally in Fig. 7) is also region-dependent. Whereas Russia and Central Asia show a strong increase in bio-energy production, the increase in land-use emissions is relatively small because the reference natural vegetation is grassland. In tropical regions, the reference vegetation (rainforest) is more carbon-intensive, and therefore bio-energy production is likely to result in more CO2 emissions from land use [22]. Nevertheless, the specific details of the land use interactions require further investigation.",221.86652

This effect is a result of improved efficiency and of substituting bio-energy and other renewables for oil, coal, and natural gas. For coal and gas, this decrease in consumption occurs mainly in the industry and electricity sector (indicated by “other”). For oil, this occurs not only in the electricity and non-energy sector but also in the transport sector The decrease in energy demand results in a fall in the price of tradable fuels (except bio-fuels) on the global energy market (Fig. 4b). The impact on gas prices is smaller, reflecting the smaller decrease in consumption and the fact that markets are less connected. A fall in the price ofnatural gas and oil fuels results in higher energy demand in regions outside the EU and China (Fig. 5a).

In Fig. 2, we compare the RefPol scenario for the world, EU and China to the 450P-CE case. In all regions, in the latter scenario unabated fossil fuel use is strongly reduced. In China and the world, the reductions take place for all fossil fuels. In the EU, coal and natural gas are already significantly reduced in the RefPol case — so the further reduction mainly involves oil that is replaced by biofuels in the 450P-CE case. There are two other key differences noticeable in all regions: first-of-all, there is a quite clear decrease in overall primary energy use. Secondly, in all regions there is a penetration ofbio-energy in combination with CCS. Fig. 3 shows the carbon leakage in the RefP-CEback scenario, i.e. the increase in emissions in the RefP-CEback scenario for the regions other than China and EU compared to the RefPol scenario. This increase results from the different leakage dynamics discussed in Section 3.2. The two channels of carbon leakage are the global energy market and land use. As shown in Fig. 3, by far the most leakage occurs via the energy market route (as a result of the fall in fossil fuel prices). We further explore these effects in Section 3.2. The small leakage via the land use channel is induced by increased bio-energy demand in the EU and China. Bio-energy demand not only affects global emissions from the land use system but also links with the energy markets (in particular, oil). This will be further explored in Section 3.3. The results indicate that total (energy market + land use) CO2 emissions for the rest of the world between 2010 and 2050 are about 10 Gt CO2 more in RefP-CEback than in RefPol. The vast majority of it occurs via the energy market channel (90%). The IPCC [16] defines carbon leakage as “an increase in",221.870485

This trend obviously leads to an increase of fossil fuel CO2 emissions. Also CO2 emissions related to land use and the non-CO2 emissions contribute to higher greenhouse gas concentrations. In total, global emissions are projected to more than double throughout the 21st century (Fig. 1a). In the reference policy scenario RefPol, the extrapolation of current policies limits the emission increase to 56 Gt in 2020 and to 69 Gt in 2050. After 2050, the emissions decline slowly (Fig. 1a). Based on the current policies (Appendix B), especially the emission trajectory of the EU contrasts shows a strong reduction from the baseline (13% in 2020 and 46% in 2050) (Fig. 1b). In China, emissions initially increase steeply in the RefPol scenario, but emissions decrease in 2nd half of the century as a result of a declining population and the assumed policies (Fig. 1c). In the default 450 ppm scenario emissions are reduced drastically in all regions, stimulated by global carbon prices of 110 (US$ 2005/tonne CO2) in 2050 and 210 (US$ 2005/tonne CO2) in 2100. The overall reductions in 2050 compared to 2000 are nearly 50%. By 2100, emissions have become virtually zero for total greenhouse gases. These reductions are achieved by a combination of energy efficiency improvement, additional use of bio-energy and renewables, fossil fuel substitution and the reduction of non-CO2 gas emissions. Finally, we introduce the two early-mover scenarios. In the RefP-CEback scenario, it is assumed that the more stringent climate policy aiming for 450 ppm in the EU and China is abandoned gradually between 2030 and 2050. Interestingly, the results of this scenario show that emissions remain below the reference level for much longer, as a result of the inertia of the energy system. In other words, investments in alternative technologies can lead to considerable path dependency (for a further discussion of path dependency and carbon lock-in, see Ref. [15]). The same result, but in the opposite direction, can be seen for the global emissions of the 450P-CE scenario: here, other countries join the EU and China in the 2030–2050 period, but still emissions remain above the 450 scenario for a very long time.",221.88763

Table 1 presents the scenarios that we use for our analysis. In the baseline scenario (base), we look at the possible development of greenhouse gas emissions in the absence of climate policies. The population and economic developments of this scenario are based on the AMPERE protocol [10]. The assumptions on the energy sector and land use are largely based on the baseline scenario developed by the IMAGE team for the OECD Environmental Outlook [12]. The reference scenario (RefPol) looks into the impacts of the short-term climate policies formulated by different countries and their possible extension in the 21st century [10]. The scenario has been extended beyond 2020 by assuming similar decarbonization rates as in the preceding period. The 450 scenario is a uniform climate policy scenario that aims at reaching 450 ppm CO2-eq by 2100, by immediate global introduction of a carbon price. Two fragmented policy regime scenarios build on the reference scenario (RefPol) but diverge after 2020 by introducing more stringent climate policies in the EU (EU) or in the EU and China (CE) in the period up to 2030, followed by either returning to the RefPol scenario (back) or converge to the 450 scenario taking on stringent reductions in all regions (450P).

The focus of the model is on describing long-term dynamics. Long-term decisions in the energy system are assumed to be governed by the relative costs of various technologies. These long-term costs are assumed to be determined by two processes: depletion and technology dynamics, which in turn are driven by production (cumulative or otherwise). The model also describes international trade of fossil/bio-fuels, by taking account of the relative costs (including transport costs) in different supply regions. An important feature of the IMAGE model is that it is also able to describe changes in land use. Key inputs in the land-use model are the demand for production offood, feed, bio-energy, and animal products. Assumptions on technology and management and on the impact of local climate and soil conditions on yields are used to determine the land requirement and allocate it to a 0.5° × 0.5° grid cell. The need to meet an additional demand for products from agriculture leads to additional CO2 emissions from land-use change. A key component of the mitigation strategies in the IMAGE model is bio-energy. This energy is used in the energy system in the form ofsolid bio-fuels in the industrial, power, and hydrogen sectors, and in the form ofliquid bio-fuel in other end-use sectors (particularly transport) and the production of feedstock. In the power sector, in the industrial sector, and also in hydrogen production, bio-energy use can be combined with CCS, providing the option ofso-called negative emissions. In IMAGE, bio-energy is assumed to be produced from crop residues and dedicated crops. The potential for the latter is based on the land model used in IMAGE: bio-energy can be produced on abandoned agricultural land and extensive grassland. Costs depend on the yields in each grid cell, regional income levels (as a proxy for labor costs), and changes in the level of technology. There are three possible interactions between regions in the context of climate policy. First of all, the regions are interconnected via fossil fuel trade markets. Reduced fossil fuel consumption in countries that are implementing climate policy is likely to depress international prices for fossil fuel, because it slows down the depletion of reserves. This may, however, boost fossil fuel consumption in non-participating regions. Second, technological learning is assumed to be shared across regions. Therefore, strong mitigation activities in some regions may reduce the costs ofnon-fossil technologies. Third, participation is likely to impact the bio-energy markets, as countries may opt to import bio-energy from other regions. This could not only affect emissions via bio-energy prices, but also directly enhance land-use emissions. Finally, it should be noted that in IMAGE, energy prices are influenced solely by long-term processes such as slower depletion. In the real world, climate policy may also influence fossil fuel prices by creating overcapacity, in turn leading to potential leakage. With respect to bio-energy production, it should be noted that the model assumes that bio-energy crops are grown only on abandoned agricultural land or natural grassland, so that CO2 emissions as a result of land use change will be relatively low. For both reasons, the figures reported in this article should be regarded as conservative.",221.87891

Current climate negotiations, however, seem not to be leading in that direction. Instead, as part of the Copenhagen Accord and the Cancun Agreement, an alternative system based on voluntary pledges has emerged, at least temporarily. The pledges indicate that countries have very different ambitions with respect to mitigation action [4]; in fact, a large number of countries do not participate in emission reduction [5]. Although the pledge-based approach has advantages in terms ofease ofimplementation, a disadvantage is that policies of individual countries can become much less effective[1], one reason being that the total volume ofemissions targeted by the policies is considerably lower than it would be if there were universal commitment. Moreover, differences between countries in the efforts made to achieve emission reduction may trigger various interactions between countries, for instance via the energy markets, including the relocation of economic activities to non-participating countries and the enhanced energy demand in non-participating countries in response to lower fossil fuel prices [4–8]. In the literature, these interactions are often referred to as leakage, as they may weaken the effectiveness of the climate policies of individual countries. Examples of leakage include the relocation of economic activities to non-participating countries and the enhanced energy demand in non-participating countries in response to lower fossil fuel prices. Climate policies can, however, also result in ‘negative leakage’, i.e. emission reductions in non-participating countries such as induced technology learning [9]. In the AMPERE project, various consequences of fragmented international climate policies are studied based on a scenario-based model comparison exercise [10]. The scenarios compare coordinated policy regimes to regimes in which the EU and/or China are the first to move ahead toward more ambitious policies. Among the different world regions, it is the EU that has most clearly expressed its ambition by aiming for an emission reduction by 80% by 2050 (to achieve a 2 °C reduction target), and to consider action even if international agreement is not reached. China's long-term policies are less clear, but the country has committed to supporting international climate policy. Together, the EU and China currently account for about a third of global CO2 emissions. In this context, it is interesting to consider what the impacts would be of a scenario in which either the EU or China—or both—would implement ambitious climate policies, whereas other countries would implement modest policies. In this paper we analyze how a situation in which international climate policies are fragmented and the EU and China are first movers, influences greenhouse gas emissions outside the EU and China in the energy system and in relation to land use. To do so, we use the IMAGE integrated assessment model. The analysis focuses on the following questions: • How do the policy regimes impact global greenhouse gas emissions? • How do these policies impact the greenhouse gas emissions change in the energy and land use system — both directly and indirectly?",221.2751

A clearer pattern of consumption impacts emerges in the 203GtCO2e scenario. The ADAGE and IGEM models both show consumption increases in 2010. In both of these models consumers face an intertemporal optimization decision of how to allocate consumption across time. Consumers are aware that the policy will be implemented starting in 2012; this will raise the cost of consumption goods in the future relative to the costs of consumption goods before the policy is implemented. As a result, consumers shift their consumption away from future periods and towards the present, increasing consumption in 2010 relative to the reference scenario.

We can use the MAC curves to understand both effects.

However, the three models achieved vastly different amounts of abatement in this scenario. MiniCAM only needed 4.8GtCO2e per year of abatement in 2050 in the 203GtCO2e scenario, the lowest requirement of any model. MRN–NEEM needed 6.5GtCO2e per year in 2050 in the same scenario, the highest requirement of any model. MERGE's abatement requirements fall somewhere in the middle at 5.7GtCO2e per year. The large level of abatement required by MRN–NEEM is one contributing factor to its high allowance price. How the MAC curves evolve over time for each model is an indication of the flexibility of the capital stock and the degree of assumed future technological advance. Looking at how much abatement is achieved according to the MAC curves for a $50/tCO2e allowance price in each year, we see some interesting results. The MAC curve for IGEM does not shift out over time; at $50/tCO2e IGEM generates 2.2GtCO2e of abatement in 2020 or 2050. In MERGE on the other hand, at $50/tCO2e the model generates 1.2GtCO2e of abatement in 2020 and 3.1GtCO2e of abatement in 2050.8 The MAC curves presented here for each year are limited to the three data points corresponding to the three scenarios in this exercise. Even so, they are still useful tools for understanding the responsiveness of the models. With three points in the MACs we can still see generally how the slope of the MACs changes on either side of the point for the 203GtCO2e scenario. In 2050, the MAC curve for ADAGE shows that the 203GtCO2e point represents a knee in the MAC curve as the allowance price is considerably higher for the 167GtCO2e scenario without much more abatement. In MiniCAM on the other hand the bend in the knee is much shallower. MERGE shows a slope between the 203 and 167GtCO2e scenarios similar to ADAGE, but shifted out and down, showing that more abatement is available at a lower price before reaching a similar knee in the MAC curve.",251.0562

The second major driver of differing cost estimates is technology, or the substitution possibilities available in the models. Higher capital costs for nuclear and CCS, or restrictions on the penetration rates ofthese technologies, would both tend to lead to higher allowance prices. Next, the flexibility of the capital stock will influence how quickly old technologies can be phased out and new technologies can be adopted. Finally, assumptions about post-2050 policy in an intertemporally optimizing model can have implications on allowance prices.

Under this policy scenario, all six models show reductions in primary energy from the reference scenario. In one model (MiniCAM), the reduction in energy consumption is small, representing less than 2% of reference energy consumption in all periods. The other models show a more substantial reduction, ranging in 2050 from 22% of reference energy in EPPA to 32% of reference energy in MRN–NEEM. These reductions in energy capture both efficiency improvements and reductions in energy services. The degree to which a model exhibits a reduction in energy use depends on its technology availability and consumer response in terms ofwillingness to reduce energy-consuming activities. The inclusion of more advanced end-use technologies in particular can result in reduced energy consumption, as consumers switch to more efficient technologies to meet the same level of service. Imposing a climate policy changes not only total primary energy consumption, but also the energy supply mix. All of the five models that include nuclear energy, bioenergy, and non-biomass renewables show increased use of these fuels under a policy. All of the models include CO2 capture and storage as a means of reducing the emissions associated with fossil fuels, but the degree to which it is used varies widely. In the EPPA model it enters only in the final period at a very low level. In other models, it enters as early as 2030. Low-carbon sources (fossil fuels with CCS, bioenergy, nuclear, and non-biomass renewables) account for between 39% (EPPA) and 62% (MERGE) of total primary energy supply in 2050 in the 203GtCO2e scenario.

The scenarios modeled in the EMF 22 exercise were not designed to represent a particular bill, but in this section we compare H.R. 2454 to the EMF 22 scenarios. The Waxman–Markey bill has a stated goal ofreducing total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions to 83% below 2005 levels by 2050. The cap-and-trade program, covering an estimated 85% of U.S. GHG emissions, allocates allowances to covered sources on a path that falls to 83% below 2005 emissions by 2050.2 Allowances to covered sectors over the period total 131GtCO2e. If the economy-wide goal was met and the cap sectors did not use outside credits, cumulative U.S. emissions would be 159GtCO2e. The bill includes additional policies beyond the cap-and-trade program designed to reduce non-covered emissions in order to achieve the overall stated GHG emissions goals, and it includes other measures directed at covered sectors, and it allows substantial outside offset credits. To compare the partial coverage of the economy in H.R. 2454, we make assumptions about non-covered sectors, adding to the cap-and-trade allowance path, assumed emissions from these sources, and different assumptions about the use ofoffset credits. In Fig. 2, the path labeled “H.R. 2454 Cap on Covered Emissions” shows the cap as specified in the bill. The three paths labeled with a “+” sequentially add to the cap assumed uncovered emissions that meet the overall emissions goals of the bill, additional U.S. emissions that would be allowed through the use of international offsets, and additional U.S. emissions that would be allowed through the use of domestic offsets (e.g. agriculture and forestry related sinks). Table 2 shows the cumulative emissions for H.R. 2454 under these different assumptions for comparison to the cumulative emissions in the EMF 22 scenarios. While H.R. 2454 has an overall target similar to the EMF 22 167GtCO2e allowance target, the domestic reductions from H.R. 2454 would only be similar to this target ifthe non-capped sources achieve the reduction goals in the bill and no outside offsets credits are used.

The scenarios include three linear allowance allocation paths for the period from 2012 to 2050 that all begin at the 2008 emissions level, followed by: (1) a constant annual level through 2050; (2) a path falling to 50% below 1990 levels by 2050; and, (3) a path falling to 80% below 1990 levels by 2050. Fig. 1 shows historic U.S. emissions and compares the range of projected reference scenario emissions from the participating models against the above-specified targets. The caps are based on CO2-equivalents, covering all of the Kyoto Protocol gases (CO2, CH4, N2O, and fluorinated gases), and using CO2-equivalent emissions factors.  The emissions caps cover the entire economy's energy-related CO2 emissions and all non-CO2 GHGs. They do not cover land use emissions of CO2 or credit CO2 sequestration from agriculture and forestry. There are no credits allowed from international emissions trading or from offsets, so all reductions must occur within the U.S. Guidelines on international assumptions for the study are roughly in line with the global delayed participation scenarios from the international transition scenario portion of the EMF 22 study. Since emissions trading is not allowed, the international assumptions likely do not have strong effects on the U.S. results, but what happens abroad can affect the U.S. through international trade. The EMF 22 scenarios allow full banking and borrowing, and the emissions pathways can be interpreted as cumulative emissions targets for the period 2012 through 2050: 287GtCO2e under the constant emissions scenario; 203GtCO2e under the 50% below 1990 levels by 2050 scenario; and 167GtCO2e under the 80% below 1990 levels by 2050 scenario. Table 1 shows these cumulative emissions along with the cumulative emissions from a range of percentage reductions for emissions in 2050 below base years of 1990, 2005, and 2008, as various policy proposals have called for different levels of reductions using different base years. This table shows, for example, that a 2050 target of 80% below 1990 level emissions for the U.S. is equivalent to a target of 83% below 2005 emissions levels. Note that recent legislative proposals have covered less than 100% of emissions and have allowed domestic and international offsets. Thus, for example, the 80% reduction scenario analyzed here requires much greater domestic reductions and involves higher costs than policy proposals with similar stated emissions targets that allow many offsets and cover less of the economy, all else equal.",251.73988

Fig. 3 shows total U.S. GHG emissions in the reference and three policy scenarios for each model.  The reference case emissions pathways show a wide range of emissions projections across the models, which is likely an important factor in explaining differences in costs among the participating models. Differing levels of emissions in the reference case imply different amounts of abatement required to meet the caps established in the three policy scenarios. The difference in 2012–2050 cumulative GHG emissions between the highest reference emissions (MRN–NEEM) and the lowest reference emissions (MERGE) is approximately 50GtCO2e. As a result, the amount of abatement required for MRN–NEEM to reach the 203GtCO2e target is 50% greater than the amount of abatement required by MERGE. The emissions pathways in the three policy scenarios are far more similar across all of the models than the pathways in the reference case, as all of the models face the same cumulative emissions targets. Differences arise because of allocation of allowances across time under the banking and borrowing assumption. Focusing on the 167GtCO2e scenario, all of the models show emissions levels below the cap level in the early years as they build up a bank of allowances, and emissions levels above the cap level in later years as the bank of allowances is drawn down. The 2050 annual GHG emissions levels differ by as much as 1.75GtCO2e. The differences in the banking behavior are driven by five factors. The main factor driving banking is the allowances distributed in each period compared with the reference emissions in the period. The allowance paths are generally “front-loaded”; that is they decline over time or are constant while reference emissions rise. Other things equal, that will tend to favor banking. A second factor is the cost, for a given level of abatement, over time, and this can work in either direction. If new low-GHG technologies only became available in later periods or their costs fall, this would favor borrowing, tending to offset the front-loading of allowance allocation. Increasing costs of fossil fuels in the long-term because of resource depletion would also reduce the relative cost of switching to technologies that do not use fossil fuels, again favoring more abatement later. On the other hand, if renewables or other low-GHG technologies face an upward sloping supply curve, their costs could rise as they are more widely deployed, thereby favoring banking. The third factor affecting banking behavior is the rate at which capital stock can be replaced. Models with limited ability to replace existing capital have higher-cost near-term abatement, thus favoring delaying abatement until later periods. The fourth factor is the interest rate used for banking.  A relatively low interest rate means that ceteris paribus the allowance price will start relatively higher, grow at a slower rate, and end relatively lower. This will lead to more abatement early on, a greater amount of banking, and less abatement in the later years.  The final factor leading to different banking pathways is the combination of foresight in the model and the assumption about post-2050 policy. MERGE, IGEM, ADAGE, and MRN–NEEM are all intertemporally optimizing models with perfect foresight. MERGE runs through 2100 and thus makes explicit assumptions about policy post-2050 which have an influence on prices in the first part of the century and the incentives to bank or borrow. IGEM, ADAGE, and MRN–NEEM only model through 2050, but make implicit assumptions about post-2050 policy through the models' terminal conditions; these assumptions will influence the incentive to bank or borrow. If the assumed post-2050 policy is stringent, decision-makers will want low emissions in 2050, thus reducing their incentives to bank reductions early in the century. MiniCAM and EPPA are recursive dynamic and assume the bank of allowances in 2050 is zero. Thus, assumptions about post-2050 policy have no impact on the emissions pathway or costs through 2050. Fig. 4 shows annual CO2 emissions from the electricity and transportation sectors in the reference case and under the three policy scenarios. In 2000, electricity sector CO2 emissions are slightly higher than transportation sector CO2 emissions (~2.3GtCO2 from electricity and ~1.8GtCO2 from transportation), and by 2050 in the reference scenario, the range of CO2 emissions projected by the models is still slightly higher for electricity than for transportation (2.5–4.0GtCO2 from electricity and 1.8–3.0GtCO2 from transportation). In scenarios with national emissions targets, however, all of the models show that the electricity sector reduces emissions more than the transportation sector. In the 287GtCO2e scenario, electricity sector emissions across all ofthe models are reduced by between 11% and 65% below the reference case, while transportation sector emissions range from 2% below reference levels to 1% above reference levels. For the 203 and 167GtCO2e scenarios, electricity sector emissions are reduced by 86% to 106% and 94% to 130% in 2050, respectively; and transportation sector emissions fall by 5% to 27% and 14% to 43% respectively. Emissions reductions larger than 100% below reference levels are due to the inclusion of biomass combined with CCS and imply negative emissions from the electricity sector. These negative emissions include the CO2 emissions uptake occurring in the terrestrial system. 167GtCO2e scenario), the electricity sector reduces emissions to levels well below the targets, while the transportation sector emissions remain well above the targets. This is an important feature of the cap-and-trade system. Sectors are not all forced to reach the same targets; instead, the emissions reductions occur where they are least expensive to achieve, and the cost of the last ton of emissions reduced in the electricity sector is equal to the cost of the last ton of emissions reduced in the transportation sector.",251.11143

Recent cap-and-trade proposals have put forward limits through the year 2050 and have featured banking of allowances over time and limited borrowing. Much of the focus has been on a cap set to 20% or less of current emissions by 2050, gradually reducing the amount of allowances over time. However, the actual level of domestic reduction that would occur depends on the extent to which external credits are allowed into the system and their availability. Actual domestic emissions reductions could be much less under some proposals that allow as much as 2 billion metric tons of credits per year from outside the system (e.g. H.R. 2454). The EMF 22 exercise developed three paths of allowance availability that would limit cumulative emissions through 2050. Interesting questions that are addressed include: (1) what are the costs of different levels of emissions reductions? (2) How will the reductions be allocated across time? (3) How will reductions be allocated across sectors? And (4) what are the implications of climate policy for the energy producers and consumers? The EMF 22 U.S. transition scenarios study explores these questions through a comparison of results from six modeling teams across three standardized climate policy scenarios.

However, especially large-scale bioenergy crop production is seen to increase the competition for land, water, and other inputs, affecting land use dynamics and leading to deforestation, emissions from land use change and agricultural intensification. (e.g. Searchinger et al. 2008, Popp et al. 2012, 2011a, Wise et al. 2009). We apply and compare three structurally different integrated assessment models (GCAM, IMAGE and ReMIND/MAgPIE) to explore drivers and impacts of bioenergy production on the global land system as well as the interaction with other land use based mitigation options. The three models differ strongly in their assumptions and definitions of land cover distribution in 2005 and the availability of biomass resources for deployment in the energy system. They also include different sets of other land use based mitigation options (such as avoided deforestation and afforestation) that interact with bioenergy. We find that different choices of bioenergy feedstocks (1st vs. 2nd generation but also woody vs. herbaceous cellulosic), land use restrictions and current as well as future management (such as irrigation vs. rainfed) for bioenergy production significantly affect simulated bioenergy crop energy yields, with results ranging from 162–491 GJ ha−1 year  in 2030. Despite the dissimilarities, a number of robust findings emerge. In baseline scenarios without climate change mitigation, bioenergy cropland represents 10–18 % of total cropland by 2100 and leads to cropland expansion, mainly at the expense of carbon richer ecosystems. Global CO2 emissions from land-use change range from 11 and 89 Gt CO2-equ cumulatively through 2100. The lowest emissions occur in IMAGE as bioenergy crops can only be grown on marginal and abandoned land, excluding carbon rich ecosystems such as forests. If also agricultural N2O emissions are considered, global co-emissions from baseline bioenergy production range from 14 to 113 Gt CO2-equ cumulatively through 2100. Disparities in these results derive from each models combination of plausible assumptions regarding, for instance, agricultural yields, economic growth, available technologies, intensities (relationships between variables) and model structure. In all models, dedicated bioenergy crops are seen as an important and cost-effective component of the energy system, especially in the scenario with the most ambitious climate stabilization targets (150–230 EJ/year in 2100). However, bioenergy interacts and competes with other land use based mitigation options. In general, bioenergy production leads to N2O emissions from fertilization but improved agricultural management (such as precision farming) increases the efficiency of nitrogen application and therefore reduces agricultural N2O emissions from both crop and bioenergy crop production (see also Popp et al. 2011b). The models also indicate that other land-demanding climate change mitigation measures (afforestation and avoiding deforestation) are cost-effective and prominent in scenarios with climate change mitigation. Simulations with ReMIND/MAgPIE show that avoiding deforestation, by pricing carbon emissions from land-use change, reduces forest loss in Latin America, Asia and Africa and hence co-emissions from bioenergy production. In addition to avoided deforestation and large scale bioenergy production, strong incentives exist under a climate policy to expand carbon stocks on land by afforestation in the GCAM simulations at the cost ofpasture and other land. Overall, land demanding mitigation measures dominate land-use dynamics and enhance the competition for land and water by either restricting land availability for agricultural expansion (avoided deforestation) or spreading directly into agricultural land dedicated for food and feed production (bioenergy and afforestation). This analysis focused on potential bioenergy land use and GHG implications within climate management scenarios. However, other social dimensions will also be important and affect bioenergy’s appeal and social acceptance, e.g., food prices, biodiversity and nature conservation and water security. Basic biophysical (such as agricultural yields), techno-economic (such as conversion efficiencies in the energy system) and socio-economic conditions (such as food demand or trade of agricultural goods) strongly influence land-use outcomes and resulting bioenergy production as well as impacts. Therefore, it will be of key importance to reduce uncertainty in the outcomes and to improve our understanding of how bioenergy and other land use based mitigation perform and interact under different sets of techno-economic and socio-economic settings. Further research to address the issue of land use based climate change mitigation in general and specifically the issue of bioenergy will be crucial to inform decision-makers about robust strategies towards a more environmental-friendly future.",345.96413

Shown are differences between the bioenergy scenarios (Base FullTech and 450 FullTech) and their respective no bioenergy reference scenarios (see Figure SI1 and SI1 for GHG emissions in the no bioenergy reference scenarios for Base FullTech and 450 FullTec respectively). Comparing to a scenario without bioenergy provides a diagnostic that isolates the emissions implications of bioenergy. In Fig. 4 we see very different emissions responses to bioenergy crops. In the Base FullTech comparison to reference, emissions of CO2 from land-use change and N2O are revealed for all models, with CO2 emissions dominating. However, the differences in the pattern of fluxes are stark. GCAM shows large initial CO2 emissions of 63 Gt CO2-equ cumulatively in the period 2005–2050 associated with early land conversion that declines with time as land conversion slows down (only 89 Gt CO2-equ cumulatively from 2005 to 2100). In contrast, dedicated bioenergy feedstocks aren't deployed in the ReMIND/MAgPIE baseline until the second half of the century, at which point increasing deployment produces increasing land-use emissions (52 Gt CO2-equ in the time period 2050–2100 alone). IMAGE has more modest bioenergy crop levels and also more modest CO2 emissions (10 Gt CO2-equ from 2005 to 2100) that occur as bioenergy crops prevent regrowth of natural vegetation on abandoned land and associated carbon uptake. N2O emissions, from the application offertilizers for non-energy and energy crop production, increase over time with bioenergy deployment and are highest cumulatively for GCAM (24 Gt CO2-equ), followed by ReMIND/MAgPIE (9 Gt CO2-equ) and IMAGE (3 Gt CO2-e) from 2005 to 2100. In the 450 FullTech comparison to reference, dedicated bioenergy deployment levels are much higher than in the baseline comparison. In IMAGE, the higher production ofbioenergy crops reduces terrestrial carbon uptake by displacing regrowth of natural vegetation on abandoned land. On the other hand, ReMIND/MAgPIE reaches up to 250 EJ per year from energy crops; however, avoided deforestation prevents CO2 emissions from land-use change by restricting cropland expansion. In GCAM, a completely different dynamic plays out. It appears GCAM is releasing huge quantities ofterrestrial carbon. However, the actual story is quite different. More afforestation is used for carbon sequestration in the land use sector when the energy system does not have the option to use bioenergy. Therefore, more carbon is stored in forests in the 450 FullTech reference scenario compared to the 450 FullTech scenario with bioenergy. Figure 4 shows the afforestation carbon opportunity cost of bioenergy. When bioenergy is available, GCAM chooses bioenergy, BECCS in particular, over additional afforestation for mitigation (176 GtCO2-equ from 2005–2100 of additional afforestation). While the land-use CO2 emissions stories vary widely, the models all project increases in land-use N2O emissions with bioenergy. However, it is important to note, as shown in Rose et al. (2013), that the integrated perspective of these models finds that, despite increased land use CO2 and N2O emissions, bioenergy can still be a cost-effective climate stabilization strategy over the long-run.",346.123318

In 2030, the highest yields of 491 GJ ha−1 year  are reported from ReMIND/MAgPIE. This is consistent with the fact that the model only considers cellulosic bioenergy crops and a large share is irrigated as the model shifts production from rainfed to irrigated for all types of crop production to minimize agricultural production costs. In GCAM, in 2030, lower yields of273 GJ ha−1 year  result due to different assumptions about future management practices (e.g. irrigation). The lowest yields in 2030 are found in IMAGE (162 GJ ha−1 year ). IMAGE only considers rain-fed woody crops and constrains bioenergy crops to marginal and abandoned land. Acreage required for food production, forests, and nature conservation is offlimits. In all models, yields increase over time—by a factor of 1.6 from 2030 to 2100 in IMAGE, 1.2 in GCAM, and 1.1 in ReMIND/ MAgPIE. These yield results are comparable with the wide range reported in the literature (see Lewandowski et al. 2000, Fischer et al. 2005, Beringer et al. 2011, Hong et al. 2011) where energy yield values range from 564 GJ ha−1 year  with irrigation and nitrogen supply to 291 GJ ha−1 year  without N supply and irrigation (e.g. Ercoli et al. 1999).",345.98825

The discussion below considers both the global and regional results. We begin by discussing the base year. The initial allocation of land defines production and conversion opportunities for a model. Table SI1 indicates that the models have similar total land cover, but notably differ in their allocation in 2005. In GCAM and IMAGE, for instance, forest and other land dominate. Yet GCAM has 500 million more hectares (ha) of forests and 500 million less ha of cropland than IMAGE. Global pasture area in both models is similar. In contrast, global pasture area is most prominent in ReMIND/MAgPIE at the expense of ‘other land’ primarily, but also forest. ReMIND/MAgPIE has approximately 1.5 billion more hectares of pasture than the other models. Regionally, all models indicate that most pasture area but also other land can be found in MAF, forest area dominates in LAM, OECD and REF, and most cropland appears in ASIA and OECD (See Fig SI1). In general, dissimilarities in the base year across the models is caused by implementation of different land use data sources and categorizations, and use ofdifferent methodologies and definitions (e.g., pasture) in deriving the land use data sets (e.g. Ramankutty et al. 2008). For example, in contrast to IMAGE and ReMIND/MAgPIE where fallow cropland is accounted in the category of cropland, fallow cropland in GCAM is reported as other land, wherefore cropland in GCAM shows much lower numbers. The land cover allocation differences, along with differences in model structure, likely affect results. For instance, smaller cropland or forest area can imply higher productivity, larger land rents, as well as GHG intensity per hectare, while conversion constraints will have a greater impact the larger the land cover allocation (e.g., IMAGE’s use of abandoned agricultural land and natural grass land, ReMIND/MAgPIE’s fixing of pasture land). Figure 2 shows that the models project very different global land cover conversion futures. In the baseline (Base FullTech), total cropland increases by 330 million ha by 2100 in GCAM (approximately the country area of India), compared to 530 million ha in ReMIND/MAgPIE, and a decrease of 180 million ha in IMAGE. IMAGE’s result is driven by ongoing yield increases and a stabilizing global population in the second half of the century. Regionally, ReMIND/MAgPIE and GCAM project increases in cropland in all regions until 2100 with the highest increases in ReMIND/MAgPIE in LAM and in GCAM in ASIA (Fig SI1). Land use changes to 2030 and 2050 are also provided in the SOM. Globally, by 2100, energy crops represent 18 % of total cropland (non-energy and energy crop) in GCAM and ReMIND/ MAgPIE and 10 % in IMAGE. In GCAM and ReMIND/MAgPIE bioenergy cropland is most prominent in ASIA and OECD in 2100. In addition, ReMIND/MAgPIE reports also high bioenergy cropland in LAM. In IMAGE bioenergy cropland is most prominent in REF. Total Cropland expansion happens mainly at the expense of ‘other land’ and pasture in GCAM, and forest and other land in ReMIND/MAgPIE. In IMAGE, forest area increases substantial as cropland and other land contract and natural vegetation regrowth occurs. The baseline contraction of cropland in IMAGE frees up land for energy crops. In the mitigation scenarios, bioenergy cropland expands significantly. Forests do as well, though for ReMIND/MAgPIE it appears as reduced forest loss (relative to the baseline). Non-energy cropland, other land and pasture are all affected, but to substantially different degrees across models. In IMAGE, total cropland (non-energy and energy) is 23 % (550 FullTech) and 28 % (450 FullTech) higher than in the Base FullTech scenario in 2100. The main driver is bioenergy cropland that covers 26 % (550 FullTech) and 30 % (450 FullTech) of total cropland. In ReMIND/MAgPIE, non-energy cropland switches from expansion in the baseline to contraction in the mitigation scenarios, however there is very little difference in conversion levels and patterns between the mitigation scenarios. Here, the share of bioenergy cropland in total cropland increases to 24 % in 550 FullTech and 450 FullTech. In GCAM, total cropland expands at the cost of pasture and other land in both mitigation scenarios. Again, the main driver is bioenergy cropland, which uses 36 % of total cropland. In all models, bioenergy cropland increases strongly in ASIA, OECD, and REF by 2100 in the 450 FullTech scenario (Fig SI1). Global forest dynamics differ strongly across the different models in the 550 FullTech & 450 FullTech scenarios. In IMAGE, forest cover is globally 12 % lower compared to the Base FullTech scenario in 2100 as abandoned land is used for bioenergy crops, instead of regrown forests (450 FullTech scenario). Due to avoided deforestation, forest cover remains almost constant in ReMIND/MAgPIE in 550 FullTech & 450 FullTech. In GCAM, global forest cover even increases by 20 % until 2100 in the 550 FullTech & 450 FullTech scenarios due to afforestation and avoided deforestation, especially in MAF, REF and LAM. Overall, the land conversions reflect structural features of the models. Bioenergy land expansion is primarily cropland and other land in ReMIND/MAgPIE due to pasture constraints and avoided deforestation, while it is reduced cropland contraction and natural forest regrowth in IMAGE. In GCAM, it is reductions in other and pasture land.",346.923926

By 2050, regional biofuel consumption is as much as 10 %, 45 %, and 70 % of liquid fuel consumption across regions in GCAM, IMAGE, and REMIND respectively, while regional bioelectricity consumption is as much as 10 %, 25 %, and 20 % of electricity consumption across regions in the three models respectively (Rose et al. 2013). Deployment grows with the stringency of the climate target. However, the levels and make-up of bioenergy deployment varies substantially across models. There is no single reason for the differences. The results derive from each models combination of plausible assumptions regarding, for instance, economic growth, available technologies, intensities (relationships between variables) and model structure. In GCAM and IMAGE, deployment increases steadily over time. In ReMIND/MAgPIE deployment levels remain constant in the first half of the century and then increase rapidly in the second half. In 2050, in the Base FullTech scenario, total global deployment levels range from 48–85 EJ/year (48 EJ in IMAGE, 53 EJ in ReMIND/MAgPIE and 85 EJ in GCAM) and increase to 109–231 EJ/year in 2100 (109, 231, and 138 EJ respectively). In the 450 FullTech scenario, 2050 global deployment levels increase to 129–228 EJ/year (142, 228, and 129 EJ respectively), with 2100 deployment of 255–324 EJ/year (255, 296, and 324 EJ respectively). Except of slightly higher deployment levels in 2100 in ReMIND/MAgPIE in the Base FullTech and in GCAM in the 450 FullTech scenario, deployment levels reported by the IAM models considered in this paper are in the range of the other 12 models applied in EMF27 that report 9–130 EJ/year in 2050 and 68–168 EJ/year in 2100 for the Base FullTech scenario and 94–207 EJ/year in 2050 and 205–300 EJ/year in 2100 for the 450 FullTech scenario (see Rose et al. 2013). Not only the time path and level of bioenergy deployment differs across the 3 models but also the share of different biomass resources deployed. In IMAGE and ReMIND/MAgPIE, cellulosic bioenergy crops and residues are used as primary energy carriers. In GCAM 1st generation bioenergy crops are also used. In the Base FullTech scenario, GCAM deploys a considerable share of 1st generation bioenergy crops, but in the 450 FullTech scenario, this decreases. BECCS energy technologies play an important role in the three models. By mid-century, BECCS energy technologies dominate global bioenergy—67 %, 50 %, and 99 % of primary energy in GCAM, IMAGE, and REMIND. By end-of-century, BECCS represents almost all bioenergy—97 %, 86 %, and 100 % respectively (Rose et al. 2013). See Rose et al. (2013) for additional analysis of global bioenergy deployment for these and other models. Dedicated energy crops are of particular importance to land use dynamics, which is discussed next.",345.92906

The first scenario does not include climate change mitigation (Base FullTech), the second scenario limits the GHG (CO2 equivalent) concentration in the atmosphere to 550 ppm in 2100 (550 FullTech), and the third scenario limits the GHG concentration to 450 ppm in 2100 (450 FullTech).

Yield increases due to technological change are either considered mostly exogenously (GCAM and IMAGE) or treated endogenously (MAgPIE). In addition, in IMAGE, agricultural yields as well as carbon content of crops and natural vegetation are affected by climatic change. All models consider carbon fluxes of vegetation and soils and greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural management. In all models, carbon emissions from land use change occur if the carbon content of the previous land use activity exceeds the carbon content of the new land-use activity. Carbon uptake occurs if a more carbon-rich ecosystem replaces a less carbon-rich one. IMAGE assumes regrowth of natural vegetation and associated CO2 uptake on abandoned land. Land use based mitigation in the models is driven by GHG prices in the mitigation scenarios. However, the models produce different GHG price trajectories for a given policy (see Rose et al. 2013) for discussion of GHG prices and other cost metrics). There are differences in the land use based mitigation options available in the models. All models include production of dedicated bioenergy crops for deployment in the energy sector and mitigation of non-CO2 GHGs from agricultural production. However, the current IMAGE scenarios do not consider avoided deforestation, and afforestation/reforestation is only taken into account by GCAM. Importantly, the models differ in their assumptions on availability of land and water resources for dedicated bioenergy crops. In GCAM and MAgPIE, bioenergy crops will be allocated based on suitability of soil and climatic conditions and the competition with land needed for the production of other agricultural goods. In GCAM, all land is available. In MAgPIE, however, managed forests and pasture land are static and cannot be used for bioenergy production. Also, nature conservation areas are not available for cropland expansion. In contrast, IMAGE allows bioenergy crops only to be grown on land other than that required for food production, forests, nature conservation and urban areas (representing successful implementation of sustainability criteria). While all models consider irrigation for food crops, IMAGE, unlike GCAM and ReMIND/MAgPIE, assumes irrigation is unavailable for bioenergy crops, again due to sustainability considerations. GCAM includes both irrigated and rainfed croplands but only implicitly, that is, they are not distinct technology choices. The greatest flexibility for irrigation is in ReMIND/ MAgPIE, which can shift production from irrigated to rainfed in response to economic or climatic drivers for all types of crop production.",346.879316

A brief comparison is given here. More detailed descriptions of each model's land modeling can be found in the SOM. First, the models describe economic decisions associated with bioenergy supply in different ways. In MAgPIE, land use decisions at the 0.5×0.5 degree grid are based on minimizing production costs. In GCAM, land is allocated to 151 biophysical regions based on profit-maximization. Finally, in IMAGE, food production is determined first by a macroeconomic description, and subsequent decisions on regional bioenergy production are based on cost minimization. The final allocation of land-use at the 0.5×0.5 degree grid within a region follows a rule-based land mechanism that accounts for crop productivity and other suitability factors, such as proximity to existing agricultural land and water bodies. The models have fairly similar land type categories, but treat land pools differently. In GCAM and MAgPIE, urban land is considered to be static, while in IMAGE, a relationship with population density is used. In GCAM and IMAGE, pasture area is driven by demand for animal products, but it is constant in MAgPIE. The models differ in terms of geographic resolution at which differences in land quality and climatic conditions are taken into account for biophysical data inputs such as agricultural production, water availability for irrigation or carbon content of natural vegetation and agricultural crops. IMAGE considers this information at the level of 0.5 degree grid cells. In this application of MAgPIE, 0.5 degree data is aggregated to 200 clusters, whereas GCAM functions on the level of 151 regions.",346.916393

The GCAM integrated assessment model links modules of the economy, the energy system, the agriculture and land-use system, and the climate. The agriculture and land-use component (Wise and Calvin 2011; Kyle et al. 2011) determines supply, demand, and prices for crop, animal and forestry production and bioenergy based on expected profitability. In doing so, the model determines land allocation across these categories, as well as pasture-land, grassland, shrubland, and non-commercial forestland. The agriculture and land-use component of GCAM is fully-coupled with the energy, economic, and climate modules within GCAM; that is, all four components are solved simultaneously. In the version of GCAM used in the EMF27 study, bioenergy provides the linkage between the agriculture and land-use component and the energy component, with bioenergy produced by the land system and consumed by the energy system. The agriculture and land component is coupled to the economy through bioenergy and carbon prices. Carbon prices are imposed iteratively until the prescribed climate target is reached. The carbon prices influence the cost of fossil fuel energy technologies, and the profitability of land cover options. In particular, GCAM assumes the carbon price is applied to carbon stocks held in the terrestrial system, incentivizing land owners to increase these stocks. As a result, strong incentives exist to expand carbon stocks under a climate policy, resulting in significant afforestation. The agriculture and land-use component is connected to the climate through emissions (CO2 and non-CO2), which are produced by the land system and passed into the climate system to calculate concentrations, radiative forcings, and other climate indicators. The IMAGE framework (Bouwman et al. 2006) describes various global environmental change issues using a set of linked submodels describing the energy system, the agricultural economy and land use, natural vegetation and the climate system. The use of bioenergy plays a role in several components ofthe IMAGE system. First, the potential for bioenergy is determined using the land use model, which takes into account several sustainability criteria: the exclusion of forests areas, agricultural areas and nature reserves (see van Vuuren et al. 2009). To model the potential production of bioenergy (and food crops), an adapted version of the Agricultural Ecological Zones (AEZ) model is used that determines yields as a function of land and climate conditions and assumed changes in technology on a grid cell basis (0.5 degree). Based on these spatially explicit attainable yields, and other suitability considerations, land use is allocated. The information on potential yields, associated costs and potential greenhouse gas emissions is translated into bioenergy supply curves for the energy submodel of IMAGE. In the energy submodel, the demand for bioenergy is assessed by describing the cost-based competition of bioenergy versus other energy carriers (mostly in the transport, electricity production, industry and the residential sectors). Climate policy can be represented by introducing a carbon price that taxes fossil fuels, but also the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the production of biomass and its conversion into bioenergy. The resulting demand for bioenergy crops as output from the energy system is subsequently combined with the demand for other agricultural products as input for the land-use system to determine future land use. Finally, the emissions associated with land use and land-use change (including N2O emissions associated with fertilizer use and CO2 emissions from deforestation) and the energy system are used in the climate model (MAGICC-6) to determine climate change, which then affects all biophysical submodels, including future crop yields and bioenergy potential. The ReMIND/MAgPIE integrated assessment framework (Popp et al. 2011a, Klein et al. 2013) provides a consistent system for the evaluation of bioenergy potentials and conflicts between economic development, food and bioenergy demand in different world regions. It consists of two components: ReMIND (Leimbach et al. 2010) and MAgPIE (Lotze-Campen et al. 2008, Popp et al. 2010). The multi-regional integrated assessment model, ReMIND, represents the energy-economy-climate system and covers a wide range of bioenergy and competing conversion technologies. The MAgPIE model consists of a global dynamic vegetation, land use and water balance model. To ensure a consistent application of these models, the land-use sector in ReMIND is represented by an emulation ofMAgPIE. To create the emulation, MAgPIE was run to derive region specific response curves for bioenergy production costs, GHG emissions from land use and land use change and marginal abatement cost curves (MACs) for mitigation from avoided deforestation. Spatially explicit (0.5 degree resolution) agricultural yields, carbon contents and water fluxes in MAgPIE come from the vegetation and hydrology model LPJmL (Bondeau et al. 2007). The underlying dynamics of and implications for the land use sector due to bioenergy deployment can be evaluated in MAgPIE using the bioenergy demand and GHG prices for mitigation in the land use sector from ReMIND to MAgPIE for each scenario. ReMIND assumes an upper annual limit of 300 EJ per year for second-generation biomass use (Klein et al. 2013). This assumption is consistent with the upper end of potential 2050 deployment levels identified in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation (Chum et al. 2011).",348.434257

IPCC’s Fourth Assessment has shown that the associated changes in climate may potentially lead to considerable impacts on ecosystems and human societies (Parry et al. 2007). Climate change can be reduced through the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions (Metz et al. 2007). Land-based mitigation strategies, especially the use of bioenergy, could have a potentially large role as part of an overall mitigation strategy (Rose et al. 2012). Biomass can be used to provide energy in many forms including heat, electricity, gaseous, solid and liquid fuels. Recently, bioenergy has received even more attention in combination with carbon dioxide capture and geologic storage (BECCS), which can lead to a net removal of CO2 from the atmosphere (Rose et al. 2013; Azar et al. 2010). However, large uncertainties exist on deployment levels of bioenergy and the impacts of large scale bioenergy on the land system, including resulting greenhouse gas emissions (e.g. Chum et al. 2011, Searchinger et al. 2008). The explicit modeling and analysis of integrated energy and land use systems is relatively new . Most analyses so far have been single-model studies (e.g.Popp et al. 2011a, van Vuuren et al. 2009, Wise et al. 2009) that do not accommodate a comparison of the various models’ land use drivers, assumptions and impacts of large scale bioenergy deployment in a consistent way (Creutzig et al. 2012). In this paper, we use a multi-model approach, allowing comparison ofdrivers and results across different models, to assess the impacts oflarge scale bioenergy crop deployment on land use dynamics, carbon fluxes within the land use system and N2O emissions from fertilizer application in scenarios with and without climate change mitigation. In addition, the interaction of bioenergy with other land use based mitigation options is investigated. The model comparison framework of the Energy Modeling Forum’s 27th Study (EMF 27; Kriegler et al. 2013) provides an opportunity to do this consistently, and do so in conjunction with the Rose et al. (2013) study that analyzes the production, use, dependence, and value of bioenergy to climate change mitigation for these and the other EMF-27 models.",346.97782

The considered model frameworks employ linked energy, economy, climate and land use modules. By the help ofthese linkages the direct competition of bioenergy with other energy technology options for greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation, based on economic costs and GHG emissions from bioenergy production, has been taken into account. Our results indicate that dedicated bioenergy crops and biomass residues form a potentially important and cost-effective input into the energy system. At the same time, however, the results differ strongly in terms of deployment rates, feedstock composition and land-use and greenhouse gas implications. The current paper adds to earlier work by specific looking into model differences with respect to the land-use component that could contribute to the noted differences in results, including land cover allocation, land use constraints, energy crop yields, and non-bioenergy land mitigation options modeled. In scenarios without climate change mitigation, bioenergy cropland represents 10–18 % oftotal cropland by 2100 across the different models, and boosts cropland expansion at the expense of carbon richer ecosystems. Therefore, associated emissions from land-use change and agricultural intensification as a result ofbio-energy use range from 14 and 113 Gt CO2-eq cumulatively through 2100. Under climate policy, bioenergy cropland increases to 24–36 % of total cropland by 2100.",346.91637

However, in the second half of the century, the model reached a lower limit on the radiative forcing that could be attained. 14 SGM employs an Armington assumption, where domestic and imported products are differentiated. The choice of Armington elasticity influences the degree of leakage. Using a higher elasticity, or a net trade assumption, would result in more shifts in production and more leakage. 16 Note that higher end-use energy prices for fossil fuels in mitigating regions as a consequence of the carbon tax leads to reduced energy demands globally, which in turn lowers the world price for fossil fuels. The degree ofreduction varies by fossil fuel. Coal supply is more elastic than oil supply and thus, oil prices tend to decline relatively more than coal prices (Fig. 12).",519.726372

The model includes key dynamics such as autonomous and price-induced energy efficiency improvements which lower the demand, stock-turnover accounting, trade of energy carriers and learning by doing which leads to cost reductions in technologies. The model has been calibrated to reproduce the IEA energy balances for the period (IEA, 1971-2005).",226.864815

Thus, we include an additional emission sector called ‘energy supply’. The TIMER model includes an ‘own energy use’ to produce fossil fuels which leads to certain emissions. Concerning biomass, the model takes into account emissions from nonrenewable fuel use in bioenergy production (as presented in Table 1) as well as net emissions due to the displace-ment of natural vegetation. For the latter, it assumes emissions to be 5–7 kgC/GJPrim, varying across regions. The emission factor has been determined using the IMAGE model as described by Otto et al. (2014). This is done by comparing two extreme runs: in which (i) no biomass is grown, and (ii) biomass is grown on all the available land. The difference in the land-based carbon stocks over the projection period, together with the yield of biomass leads to an emission factor in kgC/GJprim.

A systematic variation of availability, cost, and performance of particular energy supply technologies has been undertaken to derive implications for feasibility of climate stabilization goals and the associated costs of mitigation. Moreover, in order to complement the supply-side focus of the overall study design with a demand-side perspective, we have explored a wide range of assumptions regarding the future configuration of the transportation sector. Specifically, while a number of detailed transport scenario studies have looked into the role of electrification in this sector, there has been comparatively little consideration of the implications of such transformational change for the rest of the energy system. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap. Our analysis of the EMF27 scenarios shows that the 550 ppm climate target can still be met even if there are restrictions to the utilization of nuclear power, CCS, intermittent renewables, or bioenergy supply. Only when all of these technologies are restricted simultaneously does the 550 target become infeasible. The 450 ppm target can also be achieved in most cases, except when CCS is completely unavailable or when both renewables and bioenergy are simultaneously restricted. The former case highlights the importance of CCS as a carbon mitigation option; however, this importance is closely tied to the structure of fuel demand in the end-use sectors, most notably transport. Our standard set of EMF27 scenarios assumes a moderately high limit to future transport electrification (a maximum 25 % share of final energy over the century), consistent with the middle of the range of transport studies in the literature. Interestingly, if greater electrification is allowed, then both the 450 ppm scenario without CCS and with limited intermittent renewables and bioenery become feasible—at 35 % and 75 % maximum electrification, respectively. In contrast, the 450 scenario with limited bioenergy turns infeasible at our lowest maximum electrification rate of 5 %. The implications of electrification for scenario feasibility also play out in terms of climate mitigation costs. For instance, by our estimation the difference in costs between a 450 ppm scenario with low transport electrification compared to one with high electrification is roughly comparable to the imposition oftechnological restrictions on the supply side, such as on wind and solar electricity generation. Electrifying transport leads to ripple effects up the transportation fuel supply chain and throughout the rest of the energy system. Valuable resources (both physical and financial) are freed up that can then be used elsewhere: this resulting from an implicit redefinition of the marginal value ofcertain sectoral mitigation options. In the MESSAGE framework, for example, we find that the freeing-up of biomass resources to be used in other sectors is one of the key system-wide consequences of electrifying transport. The industrial sector subsequently becomes the main recipient ofbiomass-derived energy carriers, for both energy and non-energy uses (e.g., as a feedstock for petrochemicals). Rapid and pervasive electrification also leads to increased diversity ofthe transport fuel mix, an important indicator for energy security in a regional context. By extension, electrification contributes to far higher primary resource diversity for the transport sector. Whereas a low-carbon transport system built upon conventional liquid-based fuel delivery infrastructures is destined to become increasingly reliant on biomass (for biofuels) and natural gas (for gas-powered applications and for conversion to synthetic liquids), electrification opens up a door through which nuclear energy and non-biomass renewables (solar, wind, hydro, geothermal) can flow. A similar finding also holds for hydrogen, although not the focus of this paper.",346.926806

As shown in Table 1, some of the 450 ppm MESSAGE scenarios from the standard EMF27 set turned out to be quite close to the feasibility threshold of the model. By varying the assumptions on transportation sector electrification, two of these scenarios became feasible (in the case of higher electrification), and one became infeasible (lower electrification). An expanded discussion can be found in the SM. The scale of electrification of the transport sector also has a major impact on the total costs of climate mitigation. Supplementary Figure 3 shows for the 450 FullTech family of scenarios two different mitigation cost measures and how these measures vary depending on the scale of electrification. In both cases, mitigation costs dramatically decrease at higher electrification levels. These dynamics are due to the ripple effects that transport electrification has on fuel consumption in the industry and buildings sectors. More specifically, by obviating the need for biofuels in transport, electrification frees up valuable biomass resources that can then be used in other parts of the energy system (see Section 3.3). Further details are in the SM.",346.90754

Hence, deciding how best to distribute constrained biomass supplies is important. (See Grahn et al. (2007), Rose et al. (2013), and Calvin et al. (2013) for cross-model comparisons on this topic.) In the MESSAGE framework, the freeing-up of valuable biomass resources to be used in other sectors is found to be one of the key system-wide consequences of electrifying transport. This is illustrated quite clearly in Fig. 3, which tracks the flows of biomass and biomass-derived energy carriers all the way from the primary to secondary to final energy sectors for two relatively similar 450 ppm scenarios with different levels of transport sector electrification. As discussed previously, the 450 FullTech ET5% attempts to represent the continued dominance of conventional liquid-based fuel delivery infrastructures for vehicles; thus, biomass becomes highly valued as a source for low, or even negative-, carbon biofuels. These biofuels are directed almost entirely to the transport sector for final use. What biomass remains is consumed directly in the industrial sector, particularly as a feedstock for generating high-temperature heat and in applications where carbonaceous fuels are difficult to substitute (e.g., primary steel production), thereby replacing coal and natural gas. The 450 FullTech ET75% is far more optimistic regarding the penetration of electric vehicles and their requisite recharging infrastructure; hence, the situation with biomass looks quite different. Thanks to the lower demand for biofuels in the transport sector (though still necessary for certain applications: aviation, marine, heavy-duty trucking), the industrial sector becomes the main recipient of biomass-derived energy carriers. Specifically, direct use of biomass in industry scales up, and the sector starts to make greater use of biofuels, a trend that accelerates quickly after 2050 (not shown in Fig. 3; see further discussion below). In contrast, neither this scenario nor the low transport electrification variant (450 FullTech ET5%) sees a measurable amount of biomass-derived energy carriers directed toward the residential and commercial sector. Electricity and heat become the preferred carriers in this sector in a carbon-constrained world, though producing them does not appear to be the most optimal use of biomass when considering the competing demands for this valuable resource in other parts of the system. Moreover, it should also be noted that in the high transport electrification scenario (450 FullTech ET75%), a greater percentage of the energy contained in the raw (primary) biomass feedstock is available for use at the final energy level. This provides an indication of the higher biomass supply-chain efficiencies—across sectors and from the primary to secondary to final energy level—that electrification of transportation end-use demand technologies makes possible. (Note that a full analysis of system-wide efficiencies would also account for bio-products conversion from final to useful energy in each of the different end-use sectors.) One of the principal reasons biofuels become so attractive as an industrial input—once biofuel demands in transport are relaxed—has much to do with how MESSAGE accounts for emissions from fossil-based feedstocks (coal, oil, natural gas, synthetic liquid fuels) used to produce industrial goods, such as poly-ethylene and other petro-chemicals. For this reason, we conducted a separate sensitivity analysis with MESSAGE, varying the assumed share of feedstock carbon that ultimately is released to the atmosphere as CO2. A robust finding of this analysis is that these emission-share assumptions have a considerable impact on the costs of mitigation and, ultimately, on the feasibility of ambitious climate targets; thus, the topic deserves additional attention in future research.

The transport sector would obviously look quite different in these two contrasting scenarios, even though each still allows for the feasible attainment of the 450 ppm stabilization target (see Table 1). Moreover, through the much higher end-use efficiencies that electric-drive technologies make possible, post-2050 final energy demands in transport are significantly reduced in the 450 FullTech ET75% compared to the 450 FullTech ET5% (see footnote). Service demands (e.g., vehicle-km) are higher in the former case, however, thanks to the reduced costs of vehicle operation. In other words, there is a rebound effect: because mitigation costs are lower when there is a greater potential for transport electrification (see Section 3.4), there is less of an incentive for consumers to reduce their demand for mobility.  By our calculations, the lower price signal in the high electrification scenario would spur much less demand reduction (−9 % in 2050 relative to the no-climate policy baseline) than in the low electrification scenario (−16 %). Given that other considerations besides climate change mitigation will be on the minds of policy makers and transportation planners in the years to come (e.g., concerns over noise, air pollution, network capacity, and equity), these rebound effects should not be ignored.",346.93489

In a carbon-constrained world, the latter would be more conducive to low-carbon biofuels or fossil fuels (conventional or synthetic)—in other words, the infrastructure largely exists already—whereas the former would take decades to mature. Two of our sensitivity cases illustrate these diverging futures quite clearly. By explicitly keeping transport electrification to a low level, the 450 FullTech ET5% scenario represents the continued dominance of the conventional system; the 450 FullTech ET75%, on the other hand, is far more optimistic regarding the penetration of electric vehicles and their requisite recharging infrastructure. Figure 2 shows the evolution of the transport fuel mix in these two scenarios over the next several decades. In the 450 FullTech ET5% (upper panels), decarbonization of the transport sector is achieved mostly through low-carbon liquid fuels (biofuels and natural gas-based liquids produced with CCS), with a fair contribution from gaseous fuels (natural gas  and bio-gas with some hydrogen blending) in the second half of the century. Electricity never exceeds 5 % (by design) of final energy demand at any point. Meanwhile, in the 450 FullTech ET75% scenario (lower panels) electricity is allowed to contribute to the decarbonization effort to a far greater degree. The dominance of liquid fuels yields to the new electric paradigm: liquid fuels are consumed in lower quantities (and essentially only in the applications where electrification is exceedingly challenging, e.g., aviation, long-distance trucking, and shipping), while the share of final energy from electricity grows to almost 30 % by mid-century and to roughly 75 % by 2070. Though high in 2050, this electricity share is well within the upper limits estimated by the more detailed transport studies in the literature, as discussed above. These trends have obvious implications on the diversity of the transport fuel mix (see lines in fuel mix charts), which becomes important when discussing energy security in a regional context, as diversity affects the ability of the transport system to respond to unforeseen shocks (Cherp et al. 2012; Riahi et al. 2012). Thanks to rapid electrification, the 450 FullTech ET75% sees its fuel diversity grow quickly (globally-aggregated; measured by the Shannon-Wiener diversity index (SWDI); see SM); in fact, the level of diversity in 2050 is roughly twice that of the low electrification 450 FullTech ET5% scenario. Once electricity becomes the dominant energy carrier, however, the diversity of the transport fuel mix begins to decline and eventually saturate. Whether this backward trend would eventually arouse energy security concerns is not yet clear. It largely depends on where the different energy carriers are sourced and from which specific primary resources. For a region with a decarbonized electricity system comprised largely of renewables (a likely eventuality in a 450 ppm future), most of its electricity could actually be considered “domestic” and, thus, relatively secure, at least from an energy dependence point of view. Indeed, this is what we find in the 450 FullTech ET75% scenario: more electrification of transport means more renewables being consumed at the primary energy level to meet the final energy demands in the sector (right panels of Fig. 2). This, in turn, contributes to far higher primary resource diversity of the transport sector (see SWDI lines in right-hand charts) than in the 450 FullTech ET5%, which becomes increasingly reliant on biomass (for biofuels) and natural gas (for gas-powered transport applications and for conversion to synthetic liquids). A key conclusion here is that transport electrification opens up a door through which nuclear energy and non-biomass renewables (solar, wind, hydro, geothermal) can flow. (And although not the focus of this analysis, a similar finding holds for hydrogen.) In a conventional liquid fuels system, the potential contribution of these low-carbon energy providers is marginalized because their primary output (electricity) cannot be easily converted to liquid form.",345.820345

For each of the 450 ppm cases—with their varying assumptions for supply-side technologies—we sampled a portion of the scenario space in the transport dimension, specifically with respect to how that sector could potentially be transformed by electric-drive technologies over the twenty-first century. Several recent, detailed transport studies (considering all transport modes) conducted at varying levels of aggregation (from global to regional/national to sub-national) have indicated a large uncertainty range for transport electrification by mid-century. Interestingly, even though each of these studies frames its results within the context of transformational change—assuming, by extension, a reasonably high level of optimism for future technological development and consumer behavior – the conclusions of the studies nevertheless vary quite widely. For instance, whereas the International Energy Agency (2012) [Global], Skinner et al. (2010) [European Union], and Yang et al. (2011) [California] each find that roughly 15 % of final energy in transport could come from electricity by 2050, Teske et al. (2012) [Global] and Williams et al. (2012) [California] show that upwards of 45–55 % of the sector could be electrified. On the more optimistic end, this could require partial electrification of heavy-duty trucking (potentially via overhead wires) and certain port-based aviation and marine activities. The general expectation across all the studies is that from 2050 onward the electricity shares would rise quickly, as explicitly calculated and shown in IEA (2012). Moreover, in some of these analyses, the contribution from electric-drive technologies in 2050 grows even higher when considering the use of hydrogen for those transport applications (both road and non-road) where electricity is not well suited (e.g., aviation). Despite the vast potential of hydrogen to transform the global transport sector (as discussed in Turton (2006), Grahn et al. (2007), and elsewhere), we restrict the scope of our analysis to electricity as an energy carrier (either from the grid or distributed generation). This choice was made for two reasons. First, while hydrogen has been proposed for a range of transport applications (including for aviation and long-distance trucking), a number of unique vehicle- and infrastructure-level challenges still remain (IEA 2012; Ogden and Anderson 2011), and these challenges could ultimately constrain the scale and scope of hydrogen’s application to essentially the same transport modes as for electricity. Given this somewhat similar potential (from a whole transport perspective) and because a number of studies in the literature find that electrification could play a major role in climate mitigation (Edmonds et al. 2006; Sugiyama 2012), we decided to focus this paper on the electricity option. From the outset, our ambition was not to explore the myriad possible futures that could unfold in the transport sector. The detailed transport scenario studies highlighted above were used to benchmark our electric transport (“ET”) sensitivity cases in MESSAGE. The solution framework of MESSAGE is such that it attempts to meet demand for transportation activity with the least-cost technological options (from a systems and full supply chain perspective), based on the myriad assumptions embedded in the model and subject to a variety of constraints. One set of these constraints puts limits on the maximum amount of electricity that may be consumed in a given region’s transport sector in a given year. These limits take the form of share constraints: i.e., electricity as a share of total final energy demand. In our analysis we systematically varied these upper limits over a wide range of values—to be clear, these were the only assumptions that were modified in the “ET” sensitivity cases described herein. (As later results indicate, in climate mitigation scenarios with sufficiently high carbon prices, the model prefers to use as much electricity as is permitted by the constraints; in baseline scenarios the constraints are non-binding.) Across our “ET” scenarios, the maximum global shares range from 5 % to 75 % (at roughly equally-spaced intervals) over the course of the century. (By 2050, electrification is typically still on the rise (see Section 3.2); shares in this year span from <1 % to 60 %.) Our naming convention for the ET cases is based on these shares : for example, the “450 FullTech ET35%” scenario refers to a modified version of the standard 450 FullTech, but with a maximum electrification share of 35 % over the century. (Note that the standard 450 FullTech sees a maximum of 25 %.) The reason we designed our experiment in such a way is related to the stylized transport sector representation in the version of MESSAGE we employ here, which is far less rich in technological detail on the demand side than it is on the supply side. Yet, what the model lacks in the former, it makes up for in the way it captures the complex interlinkages throughout the rest of the global energy-environment-economic system. This is precisely the added value that an integrated assessment model like MESSAGE can provide in this research context: the ability to address sector-specific questions within a fully-consistent, systems-analytical framework. We recognize the methodological limitations of our analysis, but on the other hand appreciate the scientific contribution that such an approach can make, both to the integrated assessment and transport communities.",345.933858

As shown in Fig. 1, particularly large deviations among the alternative CO2 emission pathways exist over the coming two decades. For example, there is a total fossil fuel and industrial emissions gap of more than 5 GtCO2 between the LimBio and the FullTech case in 2020 which further opens up to about 9 GtCO2 by 2030. This near-term deviation is largely a function of long-term emission levels, which are considerably higher in the LimBio variant compared to the FullTech scenario due to the reduced potential to generate negative CO2 emissions in the former. Delay of mitigation actions in the short-term therefore implicitly means putting a bet on the availability of options such as bioenergy with CCS that actively remove carbon from the atmosphere. It should, however, be noted that some of the other technology variations also lead to changes in the emission profiles, although not as pronounced as in the case of limited CCS or bioenergy. This is true for the low energy intensity (450 LowEI) case in particular where the reduced demand in the long-term decreases emissions because of the relatively more significant contribution from bioenergy and other RE which in turn allows for more headroom over the coming decades.",345.91591

An important assumption of the analysis presented here is that concerted global action to limit climate change starts before 2020. Given the years-long deadlock of climate negotiations, this assumption may appear rather heroic; nevertheless, it is still a useful starting point for isolating the role oftechnology in the required energy system transformation. When we refer to the feasibility of such transitions in the remainder of this article, it is strictly the technological dimension that we refer to. Despite their importance (Anderson and Bows 2011), social, institutional, and political barriers to this transition are outside the scope of the analysis, although many of these factors serve as a motivation to explore the reduced technology portfolio scenarios in the study (e.g., public opposition to nuclear energy in the NucOff cases). For the less ambitious 550 ppm target, essentially all variations oftechnology availability, cost and performance do not endanger the feasibility of the energy system transformation. The only exception is the LimTech scenario in which all pessimistic technology assumptions are combined and thereby do not allow reaching the stabilization target. This is not surprising given that almost all supply-side low-carbon options—CCS, nuclear, wind, solar, and bioenergy—are excluded or at least severely constrained in the LimTech scenario which essentially leaves demand reduction (from a relatively high baseline demand) as the only viable option to reduce GHG emission from the energy system. More interesting are the technology portfolio variations under the more ambitious 450 ppm CO2-eq target which illustrate the importance of having a wide portfolio of supply-side technologies available to meet these low targets as well as successfully reducing final energy demand levels—through a combination of energy efficiency improvements and behavioral adjustments—which then allows for greater flexibility of excluding options on the supply side (cf. Riahi et al. (2012) and McCollum et al. (2012)). Based on the MESSAGE scenarios, the single most important technological option for reaching the low stabilization target is carbon capture and storage (CCS), a result consistent with findings from previous exercises that have explored the role of technology for stringent GHG mitigation (Edenhofer et al. 2010; Krey and Riahi 2009; Luderer et al. 2012; Riahi et al. 2012). Several reasons bear mentioning in this context: (i) the versatile use of CCS in different processes, from electricity generation to liquid fuel production and cement production, (ii) the possible combination of CCS with electricity, liquid fuel, or gas production from biomass, which can lead to negative emissions in the long term (Azar et al. 2006; Clarke et al. 2009; Tavoni and Tol 2010; van Vuuren et al. 2007), and (iii) the compatibility of CCS with existing supply chains, infrastructure and business models, which could lead to a faster upscaling of the technology. However, the importance of CCS is to a good degree tied to the structure offuel demand in the end-use sectors, notably in transport. The degree to which electrification is possible in the transportation sector has profound implications on the feasibility and mitigation costs of the 450 ppm target under less optimistic supply-side technology assumptions (see Section 3.4).",346.92678

The less stringent 550 ppm target is specified in such a way that CO2-eq concentrations never exceed the target level throughout the 21st century, whereas temporarily overshooting the 450 ppm target is tolerated if concentrations can be returned to this level by 2100.

Meanwhile, the demand for mobility is growing virtually everywhere, with no immediate signs of slowing down. While such trends are both an indicator and driver of increasing affluence, the great challenge for transport in the twenty-first century is to ensure that its development is sustainable: meeting the mobility demands of billions whilst minimizing the consequent environmental and social impacts (WBCSD 2004). Over the past decade, countless scenario studies have envisioned a myriad of diverging paths for the energy system at varying scales (e.g., local, national, or global; and for different sectors). Many of these studies focus in particular on low-carbon futures—how to get there, what mitigation strategies are needed, what are the costs and benefits. And while no two studies are ever the same, a common result among all of them tends to be that the transport sector must be to some extent decarbonized. For example, transport figures prominently in the climate stabilization framework of Pacala and Socolow (2004): several of the proposed mitigation strategies relate to vehicle efficiency improvement, alternative fuel production, and travel demand management. Yet, here as elsewhere (e.g., see also Bosetti and Longden (2013), Grahn et al. (2007), Gül et al. (2009), Hedenus et al. (2010), and Kyle and Kim (2011)), there seems to be little agreement on the exact role that transport should play in achieving deep economy-wide reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (by 2050 for instance), given the unique challenges faced in this sector, be they technological, economic, behavioral, or political in nature. At the heart of the issue—in fact one of the key uncertainties going forward—is the extent to which electric-drive technologies (e.g., plug-in hybrid-electric, battery-electric, and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles; electrified rail, etc.) can penetrate the global market in sufficient numbers over the next several decades. Outside of the obvious technical hurdles on the end-use side, the advent of such technologies would necessitate wholesale changes to today’s liquid-based fuel delivery infrastructure, an arrangement more conducive to fossil fuels (conventional or synthetic) and biofuels. This paper analyzes transport’s role in the decarbonization of the global energy system, considering the complex interplay between this sector and all other energy producing and consuming components of the system. Because each of these sectors faces its own unique challenges and will be forced to compete simultaneously for a limited pool of resources and financial capital, there are very real constraints to what can be achieved system-wide. To account for these inter-dependencies, we employ the MESSAGE integrated assessment modeling framework, which combines a global (multi-region, multi-sector) systems engineering, inter-temporal optimization model (Riahi et al. 2007; van Vliet et al. 2012), an aggregated macro-economic model, and a simple climate model. (Further information on MESSAGE can be found in the Supplementary Material, SM.) MESSAGE is rich in technological detail on the supply side of the energy system (e.g., resource extraction, secondary fuel conversion, and fuel delivery and transport); however, the version we employ here lacks the kind of demand-side detail (e.g., representation of technologies in the transport sector) found in other models. In short, our stylized transport module only captures fuel switching and price-elastic demand response (via linkage with the macro-economic model) at the aggregate level of the entire transport sector; individual transport modes are not explicitly modeled. Despite these shortcomings, the strength of MESSAGE lies in its ability to embed most of the key components of the global energy-environment-economic system within a common framework, thereby allowing systems-analytical questions to be adequately addressed, such as the transport-related ones focused upon in this paper. Although transport was not one of the emphases of the Energy Modeling Forum 27 (EMF27) model inter-comparison exercise, we believe the study design—with its emphasis on energy system transitions under alternative technology and policy regimes (Kriegler et al. 2013)—provides a nice platform for conducting such an analysis, principally because it allows us to (i) test the extent to which the feasible attainment of stringent climate policy targets (e.g., a 450 ppm CO2-equivalent stabilization pathway) depends on electrification of the transport sector, and (ii) assess the far-reaching impacts that transport electrification could have throughout the rest of the energy system.",345.86108

Conclusions for the delayed action scenarios differ thus from the ones that we can draw from the staged accession scenarios. The delayed action scenarios aim at exploring implications of different 2030 emission levels to reach specific long-term targets. By definition, all scenarios are thus constrained with the same 21st century CO2 emission budget to reach comparable level of concentrations, radiative forcing and warming in the long term by 2100. In this set-up, the 2030 emission target represents a perturbation of the transient pathway towards a long-term objective. Our conclusions from the “delayed action” scenarios focus thus on the transient effects and implied mid-term climate “penalties” that may arise due to suboptimal timing of policies. Given the pre-defined emission budgets, emissions by 2030 at a level of the high targets (HST) need to be compensated by more rapid and deeper emission reductions after 2030 compared to scenarios intersecting lower 2030 levels. While Riahi et al. [9] in this issue find that this has significant adverse effects for costs and feasibility ofthe transformation, we find in addition also that the delayed action scenarios carry a penalty on mid-term climate change, which is expressed most starkly by an up to 50% higher rate of warming around the 2040s, compared to the optimal scenarios. Earlier single-model studies showed a comparable effect of delayed emission reductions on mid-term warming [6]. A higher mid-term rate ofwarming may pose a challenge for the required adaptation needs and under inadequate adaptation would increase damage costs from climate change. Overshoot is also a problem for CO2 concentration, which, for example, in the staged-accession scenarios approaches 500 ppm for multiple decades, before dropping almost down to 450 ppm by the end of the century. Ocean acidification has been projected to lead to coral reefs stopping to grow above around 450 ppm CO2 and even start to dissolve above around 550 ppm, so that an overshoot of CO2 concentration brings the risk of severe damage to coral reefs, irrespective of the effects of warming that lead to more frequent coral-bleaching events [27,28]. In contrast to our delayed action scenarios, our second type of scenarios on staged accession did not constrain the long-term emissions and instead explored the consequences of maintaining a mitigation cost trajectory of the optimal pathway, starting from a 2030 emission level considerably higher. Hence, the “penalty” on energy-economics in these scenarios is limited and the emphasis is shifted instead towards a penalty on climate. Note however, that these scenarios by no means represent a weak climate policy case: still strong mitigation efforts result from a carbon price signal that does not adapt to the fact of delay, but is motivated by ambitious climate policy objectives. Nonetheless, in these staged accession cases, both mid- and long-term climate projections are affected significantly compared to the immediate action 450 scenarios, with a “best-guess” (median) warming peak of 2.2 °C, rather than 1.9 °C above pre-industrial, a 50% higher rate of warming around the 2040s, and a probability to exceed 2 °C over the 21st century about 50% higher (increasing on average from roughly 45% to 65%).",221.8708

The scenario variants that assume higher 2030 emission levels than the optimal scenarios carry some level of climate “penalty” in terms of higher mid- to long-term warming, with the largest effect on the 450 ppm CO2eq scenarios. The 450 scenarios have a reasonable probability of larger than 50% to limit warming to 2 °C over the 21st century and are generally on a downward temperature trajectory by 2100. By contrast, the optimal 550 ppm CO2eq scenarios reach emission levels by 2030 that are not very different from the weak policy/delay scenarios. We find thus that the delay scenarios, which approximate the policy stringency from the present international negotiations (pledges) to be rather consistent with a 550 ppm CO2e target. These scenarios are all associated with a probability of around 80% to exceed 2 °C within the 21st century, and all reach a much higher median estimate of warming of roughly 2.5 °C above pre-industrial by 2100. In addition, our reference policy scenario that is also linked to current policies leads to a median warming estimate ofover 3 °C by 2100. We thus find the currently proposed stringency of emission reductions to be incompatible with the long-term objective of keeping global warming below the stated objective of 2 °C.",221.46579

This is only a median likelihood, or a chance of “as likely above as below” to stay below the 2 °C long-term goal. For a “likely” chance to hold warming below 2 °C, the probability should be 66% or higher, i.e. the probability to exceed 2 °C should be lower than 33%. Here again the diversity among IAM emission pathways is important to emphasize. Fig. 8a shows 2 °C exceeding probabilities for the 450 immediate action scenario for individual IAMs. Of the 8 models that covered the whole ofthe 21st century, five achieved an exceeding probability around 33%, while all four mid-term IAMs that estimate emissions to 2050 only show behavior typical of the five low-exceeding longer-term probability scenarios. This implies that the majority of IAM scenarios provide optimal 450 pathways with a likely chance of holding warming below 2 °C. Fig. 8b shows that staged accession has the largest impact on exactly these scenarios, by increasing the probability to exceed 2 °C up to 3 times. On the other hand, these estimates are sensitive to the probability distribution of climate sensitivity in the MAGICC6 setup. The greenhouse-gas concentration region around which exceeding probability is most sensitive to small changes in concentrations might well shift for a different estimate ofthe climate sensitivity's most likely value and other characteristics like skewness and width ofthe distribution [26].",221.24397

Interestingly, while for the overall temperature change so far we only observed relatively small differences between the variants consistent with 450 and 550 ppm CO2eq, for the decadal rate significant differences can be observed. The effect of staged accession and delayed action is very strong around 2040, leading to a rate ofwarming higher by 50% for the 450 scenarios. This difference is driven primarily by higher CH4 emissions around 2030 (as the climate policies would still have to be introduced).

Fig. 6 shows the rate of warming defined by linear trends over 21 years centered around the year in question, expressed in temperature change per decade. This is very close to the change between the average temperatures over the 10 years following the year in question and the 10 years preceding that year. Both baselines and reference policy scenarios lead to decadal warming rates in the order of 0.3 to even 0.5 °C/decade throughout the century.

One approach uses the simple coupled carbon-cycle/climate model MAGICC6 that generates probabilistic information [10] about the climate response. The second approach uses a step function emulation of CMIP5 [5] general circulation models to deduce the temperature response to the forcing projections generated by MAGICC6. The comparison ofthe two approaches delivers two insights that are new to the literature. It shows how the climate outcomes from an approximation ofthe latest round ofclimate model ensemble runs relate to the temperature estimates from MAGICC6, and to this end the IAMs which often rely on this type ofsimple climate models to explore climate consequences ofmitigation pathways.",221.77005

AMPERE focused on scenario variants that deviate from the idealized assumption of immediate full cooperative action on meeting a stabilization target. First, it explored a delayed action situation where moderate levels of mitigation stringency are aimed for in the short term (2030) and the long term target is only adopted thereafter [2]. Secondly, it studied staged accession to a global climate regime, where some regions join the global climate mitigation effort at later times than others [3]. The two scenario sets allow to explore strong peak and decline emission scenarios, as well as the loss of mitigation stringency due to staged accession of key emitting countries. These types ofscenarios are highly policy relevant and at the same time sufficiently different from the standard set of representative concentration pathways (RCPs — see [2]) that have been investigated by a suite of climate models [4,5]. For example, the AMPERE scenarios with moderate near-term mitigation policies lead to a pronounced “emissions gap” over the next two decades compared to immediate and optimal climate policy scenarios, which have been the focus of the vast majority of scenarios in the past. As shown by single-model studies [6–8] and with a large suite of models by Riahi et al. [9] in this special issue, many IAM models suggest that low long-term targets compatible with 2 °C temperature change can still be reached from relatively higher near-term emissions. The transient temperature consequences of this near-term emissions gap have, however, only been explored to a limited degree [6,7]. This is thus a key issue that will be addressed in this paper.",221.883242

This is caused by an increase ofthe atmospheric concentration of non-CO2 greenhouse gases (CH4 and N2O) in the atmosphere, and at the same time, a decline in the net negative forcing caused by aerosols.

In the climate model MAGICC6 emissions of CO2 and all other greenhouse gases from the IAMs give rise to separately calculated changes in concentrations of these greenhouse gases. In addition, IAM-provided emissions of air pollutants either (a) influence atmospheric chemistry that leads to tropospheric-ozone formation and changes in the lifetime – and hence concentration – of methane, or (b) lead to tropospheric aerosols like sulfates, black carbon and organic carbon, with a cooling or warming effect on climate. The total effect of anthropogenic emissions on the climate is expressed here as CO2-equivalent concentrations, i.e. the CO2 concentration that at a given moment in time would result in the same radiative forcing as that of all greenhouse-gases and aerosols in the model combined.

Many ofthese models also include simple representations of the physical climate system, to be able to optimize emission pathways for achieving long-term climate goals. This special issue presents the results from the AMPERE project, involving a large number of IAMs aimed at limiting total greenhouse-gas emissions to achieve a set ofstandardized CO2 emission budgets. Different models achieve these budgets by means of different time-dependent emission pathways. Given (a) the wide range of approaches for estimating first-order climate-system response in IAMs and lack of these in others (e.g. [1]), and (b) the differences in the time-dependent emission pathways produced by the IAMs, the consequences ofmitigation policy cases and technological options for long-term climate goals are not immediately clear and comparable across IAMs.",221.845
